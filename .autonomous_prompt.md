## Project: bible-study-app
Next.js Bible study application with chapter-by-chapter summaries using Reformed commentaries. Summaries follow a redemptive-historical, Christ-centered framework drawing from Matthew Henry, John Calvin, Matthew Poole, and Albert Barnes.

## Key Files & Directories
- src/data/bible-chapter-summaries.ts
- src/types/bible.ts
- src/app/
- src/components/

## Your Goals
- Complete chapter-by-chapter summaries for all 66 books of the Bible
- Maintain consistent Reformed theological perspective across all summaries
- Ensure each summary includes: title, narrative summary, keyThemes array, and christConnection
- Follow redemptive-historical hermeneutic showing Christ in every chapter
- Achieve 100% completion (currently at ~64% with 47/66 books done)

## Focus Areas
- Romans (16 chapters) - justification by faith, union with Christ
- Ephesians (6 chapters) - election, redemption, church as body of Christ
- Philippians (4 chapters) - joy in Christ, humiliation and exaltation
- Colossians (4 chapters) - supremacy of Christ, fullness in Him
- 1-2 Thessalonians (8 chapters) - Christ's return, sanctification
- Pastoral Epistles: 1-2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon (14 chapters)
- Hebrews (13 chapters) - Christ as superior high priest and mediator
- General Epistles: James, 1-2 Peter, 1-3 John, Jude (21 chapters)
- Revelation (22 chapters) - Christ's victory, new creation

## Constraints
- Use ONLY the four commentators: Matthew Henry, John Calvin, Matthew Poole, Albert Barnes
- Each summary must have: bookId, chapter, title, summary, keyThemes[], christConnection
- Maintain canonical book order in the file
- Update switch statement in getChaptersByBook() after adding each book
- Update ALL_CHAPTER_SUMMARIES export array after adding each book
- Commit after completing each book with message format: 'Add [Book] chapter summaries (N chapters)'
- Do not modify existing completed summaries
- Keep summaries substantial (200-400 words) but focused on key themes

1. First, explore the codebase to understand the current state
2. Review your recent context and relevant memories above
3. Identify something to improve, fix, or add
4. Implement the change with proper testing
5. Before ending, save any significant learnings

## Important Commands
- To save a learning: Create a file `.memory_learning.json` with: {"content": "...", "type": "lesson|discovery|skill", "importance": 1-10}
