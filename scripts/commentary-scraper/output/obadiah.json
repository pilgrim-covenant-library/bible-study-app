        "quote": "Matthew Henry's commentary on Obadiah 1 presents Edom as a prophetic symbol of those who oppress God's people, emphasizing divine judgment against pride and hostility. The text reveals Edom's destruction as a consequence of its arrogance—its refusal to acknowledge God's sovereignty, its violent actions against Judah during crisis, and its reckless confidence in security (\"clefts of the rock\"). Theologically, Henry stresses that God's justice is impartial: those who exalt themselves against His people face ruin, while the righteous find deliverance in Him. This prophecy underscores a critical truth: all violence against God's church is sinful, and divine retribution comes swiftly to the unrepentant. Practically, it calls believers to reject worldly pride, actively avoid taking pleasure in others' suffering, and diligently serve the needy—especially during times of communal distress—rather than acting as passive spectators or oppressors. Crucially, Henry connects this prophecy to Christ: Edom's final destruction prefigures the ultimate judgment on religious pride and the triumph of the gospel. The \"house of Jacob\" (the church) becoming strong while Edom (the false religious system) is consumed mirrors Christ's victory over sin and death. This promise of deliverance on Mount Zion—where God's people find true security—points to the New Covenant, where Christ, the true \"house of Jacob,\" brings eternal salvation through His atoning work, ensuring that those who trust Him, not human systems, will endure. The commentary thus urges humility, active compassion, and unwavering hope in Christ as the only foundation for true security. (248 words)",

        "quote": "Calvin's commentary on Obadiah 1 emphasizes the divine authority behind prophetic revelation and God's sovereign orchestration of judgment. He interprets the \"rumor\" heard by the prophet as God's secret initiative, revealing that Edom's impending destruction was not accidental but deliberately orchestrated by the Lord through His agents, highlighting that human conflicts stem from divine providence, not chance. Calvin stresses that Obadiah's vision explicitly attributes the message to God alone, rejecting any human pretension to prophetic insight—a critical theological point affirming that true revelation originates solely with God, not human speculation. Crucially, Calvin connects this to Christ: the \"messenger sent among the nations\" (Obadiah 1:2) directly points to Jesus Christ, who, as the divine agent of God's judgment, brings accountability to those who reject God's covenant. Edom's pride—dwelling in \"the clefts of the rock\" yet claiming divine security—becomes a powerful illustration of human arrogance that blinds individuals to God's sovereignty. Practically, Calvin urges believers to cultivate humility in the face of adversity, recognizing that God's judgment flows from sin, not human ambition. This passage challenges Christians to avoid prideful self-reliance, especially when circumstances seem favorable, and to trust Christ as the ultimate \"messenger\" who executes divine justice against spiritual rebellion. Ultimately, Obadiah's warning serves as a timeless reminder that true security lies not in human strength but in Christ's sovereign authority and the humility to accept God's judgment. (248 words)",

        "quote": "Matthew Poole's commentary on Obadiah 1 emphasizes God's sovereign judgment against Edom for its profound pride and destructive actions, particularly their cruelty during Jerusalem's fall. Poole clarifies that the prophet Obadiah (not the one associated with Ahab) delivers a divine vision where Edom's arrogance—dwelling in inaccessible rock clefts, boasting of invincibility, and even comparing itself to eagles nesting among stars—becomes the target of God's wrath. Theologically, this passage reveals God's absolute authority over nations that reject His sovereignty, highlighting how human pride and self-reliance inevitably lead to divine discipline. Practically, it warns believers to avoid the dangerous illusion of security in their own strength or status, urging humility before God's ultimate control. Crucially, Poole connects this judgment to Christ's victory: just as Edom's pride was doomed to destruction by God's chosen power (Nebuchadnezzar, as Poole notes), Christ's triumph over sin and death ultimately overcomes all opposition to God's people. Edom symbolizes spiritual enemies who oppose God's kingdom, but Christ's resurrection ensures their defeat. This commentary thus calls Christians to embrace Christ's humility, recognizing that true security comes only through divine grace, not human pride or self-sufficiency, while trusting in Christ's final victory over all who would oppose God's purposes.

        "quote": "Albert Barnes's commentary on Obadiah 1 emphasizes the prophetic clarity of God's warning against spiritual pride, particularly rejecting historical speculation about the prophet's identity and era to focus on the text's moral authority. Barnes meticulously argues that the Hebrew language—specifically the future tense with \"al\" (do not)—unambiguously indicates Edom's sin described is future, not past, meaning the prophecy warns against present and future arrogance in the face of Judah's destruction. This linguistic precision underscores a core theological insight: God's warnings apply to ongoing spiritual rebellion, not retrospective guilt. Practically, this challenges believers to actively resist pride and selfish triumph in times of others' distress, rather than dwelling on past errors. Barnes connects this to Christ's fulfillment: Edom symbolizes spiritual enemies who exploit others' weakness—precisely the opposition Christ overcame. In the New Testament, Christ's victory resolves the prophecy's tension, showing that true \"brotherly\" relationship (as in the New Covenant) supersedes Edom's enmity. This Christ-centered perspective transforms the prophecy from historical judgment into a call to humility and unity, urging believers to reject the spirit of Edom—selfish pride and false triumph—by embracing Christ's reconciling love. The commentary thus affirms that God's prophetic voice remains timeless, demanding present obedience while pointing to Christ as the ultimate resolution of such conflicts. (248 words)",
