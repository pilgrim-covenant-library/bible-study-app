        "quote": "Henry observes that Daniel chapter 1 reveals Nebuchadnezzar's Babylonian captivity of Jerusalem, where he selects four Hebrew youths—Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah—to train in Babylonian wisdom. Despite renaming them to assimilate them into idolatrous practices (Belteshazzar, Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego), Daniel resolutely refuses the king's food and wine, prioritizing his covenant faith. The prince of the eunuchs tests them for ten days with a simple diet, and Daniel's group emerges physically and mentally superior, demonstrating that spiritual integrity—maintained through deliberate discipline—outweighs worldly indulgence. Theologically, this underscores God's sovereignty in preserving faithful hearts amid cultural pressure; Daniel's refusal reflects the principle that true wisdom and divine favor flow from purity of heart, not merely intellectual acuity. Practically, it challenges believers to actively resist assimilation into sinful systems—whether cultural, social, or digital—by choosing disciplined habits that honor their identity. Christologically, Daniel's steadfastness prefigures Christ's own rejection of worldly systems (e.g., the \"food\" of sin in John 8:34) and the promise that those who uphold purity will be equipped for divine purposes. Henry emphasizes that this story is not merely about dietary choices but about the spiritual discipline required to remain \"uncontaminated\" in a fallen world, urging modern believers to cultivate inner resilience against temptation, knowing that God rewards consistent fidelity with wisdom and honor, just as He prepared Daniel for prophetic service that would ultimately point to Christ.

        "quote": "Calvin's commentary on Daniel 1 centers on the historical context of Jerusalem's siege in Jehoiakim's third year, clarifying Nebuchadnezzar's role—whether acting under his father's command or personally—while emphasizing God's sovereign agency in the capture. Calvin stresses that Jehoiakim's deliverance into Nebuchadnezzar's hand was not due to human power but divine judgment, directly countering the notion that Babylon's conquest violated God's covenant with Abraham. Theologically, this underscores God's incomprehensible sovereignty: His judgments transcend human understanding and political timelines, as seen in Daniel's early exile despite his exceptional piety. Practically, Calvin warns against human arrogance in interpreting God's plans, urging believers to recognize that trials—like exile—serve God's purpose rather than reflect moral failure. Christologically, Daniel's faithfulness amid captivity foreshadows Christ's submission to God's will despite suffering; just as Daniel remained devoted to God's worship in Babylon, Christ endured the cross to fulfill divine purpose. Calvin concludes that Daniel's story reveals God's grace in sparing the righteous while holding accountable the unfaithful, teaching us to trust His providence even when circumstances seem unjust. This historical event thus points to the ultimate Christ-centered truth: God's sovereignty triumphs through those who remain faithful, offering profound hope in Christ's redemptive work that reconciles all things to God.

        "quote": "In Matthew Poole's commentary on Daniel chapter 1, the historical context of Jerusalem's fall under Nebuchadnezzar's siege reveals profound theological significance. Poole meticulously connects Daniel's selection as a captive from Judah to the divine sovereignty over Judah's exile, emphasizing that God deliberately placed Daniel and three companions in Babylonian service despite the kingdom's sin. The key moment occurs when Daniel refuses the king's meat and wine, a deliberate act of spiritual integrity that Poole interprets as a conscious rejection of idolatrous practices and cultural assimilation. Theologically, this demonstrates God's preservation of faithful hearts in exile—Daniel's refusal becomes a prophetic sign of God's ongoing work among the oppressed, foreshadowing Christ's ultimate triumph over all empires. Poole highlights that the name changes imposed by the king (e.g., Daniel to Belteshazzar) were an attempt to sever their identity from God, yet Daniel's steadfastness reveals that true identity remains rooted in divine covenant. Practically, this narrative instructs believers to resist cultural pressures that compromise moral or spiritual integrity, especially in contexts of power or influence. Crucially, Poole connects Daniel's future role as a wise counselor to Christ's own mission: Daniel's prophetic vision of God's sovereignty in Babylon prefigures Christ's authority over all earthly kingdoms, illustrating how faithfulness in adversity points directly to the Messiah who will ultimately restore God's people. This historical account thus becomes a timeless lesson for maintaining spiritual authenticity while navigating cultural challenges, with Christ standing as the fulfillment of Daniel's divine purpose.

        "quote": "Albert Barnes's commentary on Daniel chapter 1 emphasizes Daniel's extraordinary background and early faithfulness as a model for Christian living. Daniel, a young Hebrew of noble descent captured in Babylon, was selected with three companions for rigorous Chaldean education to serve the court. His pivotal decision—refusing the king's food to maintain religious purity and avoid idolatrous practices—demonstrates profound theological insight: true faithfulness requires deliberate, disciplined obedience to God's principles even when facing cultural pressure or personal risk. This choice, sustained for three years, resulted in divine favor and a prominent role, revealing that spiritual integrity, rooted in God's law, consistently yields divine blessing and practical usefulness. Theologically, this underscores that faith is not passive acceptance but active resistance to compromise, where obedience to God's standards becomes a source of strength and purpose. Practically, believers today can emulate Daniel's commitment to intentional spiritual discipline—prioritizing purity of heart and body over societal pressures—without isolation, by integrating faith with responsible engagement in the world. Christologically, Daniel's story prefigures Christ's own separation from sin: just as Daniel refused idolatry to preserve his identity in God, Christ refused sin's power to secure eternal life. Daniel's later prophetic role also foreshadows Christ as the ultimate interpreter of divine truth, revealing that true leadership and wisdom flow from unwavering allegiance to God's character, not human systems. This narrative challenges modern Christians to choose faithfulness in their cultural contexts, knowing that Christ's victory over sin and death is secured through obedience to the same principles Daniel upheld.

        "quote": "Matthew Henry's commentary on Daniel chapter 2 emphasizes the profound contrast between human futility and divine revelation, revealing theological insights about God's sovereignty and practical lessons for believers. The chapter depicts Nebuchadnezzar's desperate search for his dream's meaning, where the magicians and astrologers—despite their prestige—fail utterly, prompting the king to order their execution. Daniel's success arises not from his own wisdom but from humble prayer (2:14-15), where he seeks God's intervention for his life and the kingdom's future. Henry stresses that God alone unveils truths beyond human capacity, as Daniel declares: \"There is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets\" (2:28). Theologically, this underscores that true authority belongs solely to God, who \"changeth the times and the seasons\" (2:21) and reveals \"the deep and secret things\" (2:22), directly countering anthropocentric claims of human wisdom. Crucially, Henry connects this to Christ: the \"image\" Daniel interprets—representing successive earthly kingdoms (gold for Babylon, silver for Persia, brass for Greece, iron for Rome)—foreshadows Christ's ultimate triumph. The \"stone that broke the image\" (Daniel 2:44) symbolizes Christ's kingdom, which crushes all human empires. Practically, this calls believers to cultivate prayerful humility, trusting God's revelation in crises rather than human schemes. As Daniel's prayer saved his life, modern Christians are urged to seek God's wisdom in political and personal turmoil, recognizing that Christ's eternal kingdom—established through the cross and resurrection—will ultimately dismantle all earthly power, offering hope beyond temporal kingdoms.

        "quote": "Calvin addresses the historical context of Daniel 2 by resolving Nebuchadnezzar's reign year to align with Daniel's earlier training under the king's father, emphasizing that the dream's profound nature—marked by the king's \"spirit contrite\" terror—signifies divine origin rather than natural causes. He contrasts human explanations for dreams (fever, stress, or imagination) with the scriptural revelation that God uses dreams to communicate His sovereignty, as seen in Nebuchadnezzar's crisis of power. Theologically, Calvin underscores that this dream reveals God's active governance over history, where earthly empires (the \"image\") inevitably crumble before Christ's eternal kingdom—the \"stone that crushes the mountains\" (Daniel 2:44). This Christ-centered interpretation connects the dream's climax to Christ's future reign: the stone represents the Messiah who will establish an unshakable kingdom, subduing all false powers. Practically, Calvin's commentary urges believers to examine their spiritual \"dreams\" (anxieties, false security) with humility, recognizing that true peace comes not from human solutions but from surrendering to God's revealed truth. When worldly authority causes distress, as Nebuchadnezzar experienced, the response must be seeking divine wisdom rather than self-deception. This highlights Christ's sufficiency: His kingdom, established by the Spirit, transcends human ambition, offering the only lasting resolution to life's chaos. Modern readers are called to heed this lesson—trusting God's sovereign purpose in their struggles, where Christ's eternal rule provides the only foundation for true security. (278 words)",

He notes that Nebuchadnezzar's dream—troubled and unexplainable to the king's own magicians and astrologers—served as a divine test, revealing the Chaldeans' arrogance and their reliance on false wisdom. Poole highlights that the magicians' failure to interpret the dream stemmed from their adherence to demonic arts and human pretensions, not divine revelation, underscoring God's active role in exposing spiritual deception. Crucially, Poole connects Daniel's successful interpretation to God's providential plan: Daniel, distinct from the magicians, was chosen to reveal the dream's meaning, demonstrating that true wisdom flows from God alone, not human systems of magic or idolatry. Theologically, this narrative affirms that God transcends all human attempts to control destiny or understand divine mysteries, rejecting the false notion that idols or human intellect can access divine truth. Practically, it calls believers to avoid self-reliance in spiritual matters, recognizing that genuine understanding comes through Christ—just as Daniel's revelation pointed to God's kingdom, Jesus Christ is the ultimate interpreter of God's will, fulfilling Daniel's prophetic vision. This context encourages Christians to seek God's wisdom in crises, reject false idols (including cultural or spiritual shortcuts), and trust Christ's revelation as the sole source of true understanding and purpose in a world of uncertainty.

He argues that ancient cultures, including the Hebrews and pagans, relied heavily on dreams as divine communication, and forgetting dreams was common; thus, Nebuchadnezzar's request aligns with human cognitive patterns and his arbitrary, passionate nature as a ruler. Theologically, this underscores God's sovereignty in using seemingly chaotic human experiences—like dreams—to reveal His will and future plans, bypassing human reasoning. Practically, believers should recognize that spiritual crises or \"forgotten\" insights often require patience and trust in God's timing, rather than insisting on immediate clarity. Crucially, Barnes connects Daniel's story to Christ as the ultimate fulfillment of the \"stone that crushes the kingdoms\" (Daniel 2:44), revealing that Christ's coming fulfills the prophecy of God's authority overcoming all human empires through His divine nature. This narrative teaches that true power comes not from human wisdom or political might but from Christ's sovereign reign, urging believers to surrender their ambitions to God's purpose and find hope in His promises that transcend earthly power structures.

Henry emphasizes that the king's decree—enforcing false worship through immense pressure—mirrors how pride and worldly influence often compel societies to adopt idolatrous practices, targeting those who remain steadfast in truth. Theologically, the three men's unwavering declaration—\"Our God... will deliver us out of thine hand\"—illustrates the sovereignty of God over human kingdoms and the absolute priority of divine allegiance over temporal power. Crucially, Henry identifies the \"fourth figure\" walking in the furnace as Christ himself, demonstrating God's active presence and victory even in the most severe trials. This Christ connection transforms the narrative: the fiery furnace becomes a symbol of Christ's own sufferings, where believers find divine strength to resist compromise without fear. Practically, Henry urges Christians to stand firm against societal pressures to conform to false values, avoiding the trap of \"parleying with temptation\" when moral choices are clear. Just as the three men trusted God's deliverance rather than human threats, believers today must resolve to obey God rather than man, knowing Christ empowers them to endure suffering without being consumed by fear or worldly allegiance. Their example teaches that true faith is not passive endurance but an active, Christ-centered commitment that finds liberation in divine presence—even when the furnace seems impossibly hot.",

He argues that Nebuchadnezzar's construction of the gold image—despite claiming to honor God—reveals a deep hypocrisy: his public confession of Israel's God was limited and superficial, masking his enduring impiety and ambition to elevate himself among deities. Calvin stresses that Nebuchadnezzar's actions were not genuine conversion but a temporary concession to avoid divine wrath, demonstrating how human pride often disguises spiritual rebellion under the guise of devotion. The furnace trial, Calvin insists, is not merely a physical test but a theological revelation: it exposes the futility of human authority when opposed to God's sovereignty. Crucially, Calvin connects this narrative to Christ by highlighting that the true \"image\" of God—unlike Nebuchadnezzar's false idol—is Christ himself, who embodies divine authority without compromising truth (John 1:14). The three Hebrews' unwavering faith in God's protection, even in the furnace, prefigures Christ's own crucifixion where obedience to divine will triumphs over human judgment. Practically, Calvin's insight calls believers to rigorous self-examination, rejecting idolatry in modern contexts like materialism or social media worship, and trusting God's power in crises rather than human systems. This chapter reminds us that true faith endures when loyalty to Christ transcends temporal pressures, ensuring that our worship remains rooted in the one true God who holds all power and glory.

Poole emphasizes how the king's command—forcing universal conformity to idolatrous worship—exposed the fragility of human authority and the peril of prioritizing temporal glory over divine truth. The trio's refusal, grounded in faithfulness to God, becomes a profound theological lesson: God's sovereignty triumphs over earthly power when His people steadfastly reject idolatry, even when it means facing fiery destruction. Poole connects this event to Christ's ultimate sacrifice, noting that the furnace represents the crucible of persecution where Christ, the true \"image\" of God (Colossians 1:15), endured injustice to restore relationship with a rebellious world. Practically, this story warns against modern idolatry—where cultural pressures, social media, or materialism become false gods that demand worship without spiritual integrity. Christians must resist the \"gaudy dress\" of worldly conformity (as Poole describes idolatrous rituals using music and spectacle), recognizing that authentic worship remains deeply personal and unshakable. Like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, believers must stand firm in Christ, knowing that God's power protects those who refuse to compromise their faith, even when the world brands them as heretics.

Barnes stresses that Nebuchadnezzar, as an arbitrary ruler accustomed to absolute submission, issued this decree without anticipating resistance from the Hebrews, who were known to worship Jehovah yet understood the practice of honoring other deities.

The king, once powerful and confident, experiences a severe divine judgment—losing his reason and being reduced to a beast—due to his self-conceited pride, illustrating how God's sovereignty actively opposes human arrogance. Henry emphasizes that this temporary humiliation serves a critical purpose: Nebuchadnezzar's restoration after repentance demonstrates God's merciful character, showing that even the greatest sinners can be restored through humble submission. Theophatically, the vision of the tree (representing Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom) being cut down yet leaving a rooted stump signifies that God's ultimate authority remains unshaken, while human kingdoms inevitably pass. Crucially, Henry connects this to Christ: just as Nebuchadnezzar's pride led to temporary loss, Christ's voluntary submission to the cross—though seemingly a divine humiliation—reveals God's ultimate victory over sin and death. Practically, this commentary urges believers to actively guard against pride, recognizing that God's discipline (like the seven-year period) is often a call to repentance and restoration, not condemnation. It challenges leaders and individuals alike to cultivate humility, seek divine mercy, and trust God's sovereign purpose over temporary setbacks, ensuring that true greatness flows from Christ-like selflessness rather than human ambition.

He also notes the absence of detailed pagan records—Josephus confirms only sparse references from Chaldean sources like Berosus—showing that the omission of such events by ancient historians does not invalidate the chapter's truth. Theologically, this narrative powerfully illustrates God's sovereign authority over human kingdoms and pride: Nebuchadnezzar's temporary earthly power collapses when he rejects divine wisdom, revealing that human arrogance inevitably leads to divine discipline. Practically, this calls believers to cultivate humility and avoid self-reliance, recognizing that true strength comes from submission to God's purposes rather than human achievement.

Henry emphasizes that God's written word alone—like the handwriting on the wall—can strike even the most arrogant with terror, exposing the futility of worldly wisdom and the emptiness of idolatrous rituals. This divine intervention demonstrates that true authority resides solely with the Most High God, who judges all actions and reclaims sovereignty when human pride defies Him. Theologically, Henry connects Belshazzar's downfall to the universal human condition: sinners who reject God's revelation and worship false idols face divine judgment, as the \"hand\" writing the decree is Christ Himself revealing God's ultimate authority (John 1:1). Practically, this commentary urges immediate repentance when conscience warns of spiritual danger, rejecting worldly rewards and false idols that promise security. Belshazzar's story shows that true peace comes not from human status or temporal power but from surrendering to Christ—the only one who \"sees, hears, and knows\" (Daniel 5:23), whose blood alone cleanses from sin and whose kingdom reigns eternally.

        "quote": "Calvin interprets Belshazzar's feast in Daniel 5 as a profound illustration of divine sovereignty and spiritual peril, emphasizing that the king's reckless celebration while Babylon faced imminent destruction revealed his profound spiritual blindness. Calvin notes the critical context: Belshazzar's feast occurred just as Babylon's fall was imminent, despite the king's awareness of his city's vulnerability—Cyrus had already begun the siege. This scene underscores God's meticulous timing in judgment, where the wicked's impious pride (celebrating lavishly while the city was besieged) becomes the very catalyst for their downfall. Theologically, Calvin stresses that God's providence ensures the destruction of the unrepentant, not through random chaos but as a necessary consequence of spiritual neglect. Practically, this warns believers to avoid the fatal error of prioritizing worldly security and pleasure over divine warnings, especially when societal or personal crises loom. Crucially, Calvin connects this to Christ: the \"stone that crushes the kingdoms\" in Daniel 2 (the stone that becomes the head of the world's governing stone) is Christ himself, whose victory over sin and empire fulfills the prophecy. Belshazzar's story thus serves as a mirror for Christians, urging vigilance against pride and idolatry while pointing to Christ as the only true foundation that withstands all earthly power and judgment. In modern terms, it challenges believers to discern God's timing in their own struggles, resisting the allure of temporary glory when spiritual truth is ignored.",

        "quote": "Matthew Poole's commentary on Daniel 5 reveals Belshazzar's catastrophic downfall as a profound warning against idolatry and pride. The king, having profaned God's holy vessels in a drunken feast honoring false gods, faced divine judgment when a hand wrote on the wall—a visible sign of God's wrath. Poole emphasizes that Belshazzar's sin was not merely ritualistic but a deliberate rejection of divine authority, where he sought to replace God with idols of wealth and power. Theologically, this scene underscores God's sovereignty over human kingdoms and the futility of human wisdom when opposed to divine revelation. Belshazzar's failure to heed Daniel's interpretation—rooted in God's providence—illustrates the peril of spiritual blindness and the consequences of idolatry, which Poole links directly to the heart of human rebellion. Practically, this narrative calls believers to examine their own \"golden vessels\" of pride, materialism, and false idols that distract from Christ. Modern applications include resisting the temptation to idolize wealth, status, or fleeting pleasures while seeking God's wisdom in crises. Crucially, Poole connects this event to Christ: Belshazzar's kingdom was destroyed by the Medes, foreshadowing Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death. The hand-writing, interpreted by Daniel as a judgment on Belshazzar's pride, prefigures Christ's atoning work—where God's judgment is satisfied through Christ's sacrifice, turning the \"handwriting\" of sin into redemption. This passage thus urges believers to trust Christ as the only true interpreter of God's will, avoiding the pitfalls of self-reliance and idolatry that led to Belshazzar's ruin.",

Theologically, he underscores that Daniel's ability to interpret the mysterious writing stems not from human wisdom but divine empowerment, a critical insight that reveals God's active role in revealing truth where human understanding fails. This divine intervention directly addresses the chapter's purpose: Belshazzar's desecration of temple vessels—symbolizing Israel's spiritual betrayal—triggers a divine warning that Babylon's fall is a consequence of such sin, not merely political chaos. Barnes connects this to broader prophetic themes, showing how God's judgment on nations stems from their treatment of His people, especially the temple's desecration. Practically, this commentary calls believers to examine their own spiritual state, recognizing that moral decay (like Belshazzar's idolatry) invites divine consequences, while genuine repentance opens pathways to restoration. Crucially, Barnes positions Daniel as a prophetic type of Christ, whose ultimate authority to interpret God's will and restore His people—through atoning sacrifice—fulfills the chapter's deeper purpose. Just as Daniel's interpretation averted immediate destruction through divine warning, Christ's atonement resolves the ultimate spiritual consequences of sin, offering salvation and the restoration of God's kingdom. This Christ-centered lens transforms the chapter's warning into a call for humility, repentance, and trust in the One who truly interprets and saves. (248 words)",

Henry highlights how Darius' decree forbidding prayer for thirty days—intended to suppress spiritual devotion—exposes the peril of spiritual neglect, arguing that true worship cannot be compromised by temporal pressures. He stresses that Daniel's daily, open prayer before Jerusalem, even while under threat, reveals prayer as a non-negotiable covenant with God, not a luxury for the busy. Theologically, Henry underscores that God's sovereignty ensures the deliverance of the faithful: Daniel's unharmed emergence from the lions' den demonstrates that divine protection operates through genuine faithfulness, not human strength. Practically, this demands consistent, humble prayer discipline—especially for those with responsibilities—avoiding the trap of spiritual cowardice under pressure. Crucially, Henry connects Daniel's story to Christ: just as Daniel's God intervened personally to shut the lions' mouths, Christ, as the eternal High Priest, intercedes continually before the Father (Hebrews 7), providing the true basis for confident prayer and deliverance from spiritual and physical danger. This Christ-centered perspective transforms the chapter's lesson: believers are not merely to endure trials but to trust in the One who already won victory through the cross, ensuring that no earthly decree can ultimately prevail against God's faithful people.

Daniel's unique position, granted not by personal merit but by divine favor, demonstrates how God uses faithful servants to protect the vulnerable and restore order, particularly for the Jewish exiles. Calvin emphasizes Daniel's \"excellent spirit,\" a divine endowment that enabled him to stand above worldly rivals, contrasting the corrupt nature of human power with God's spiritual authority. This divine selection, Calvin argues, was directly responsive to Daniel's prior prophetic warnings against Babylonian rule, showing how God orchestrates His servants to fulfill His purposes even in hostile contexts. The practical application lies in recognizing that true leadership and influence stem from Christ-like integrity—where faithfulness to God, not political maneuvering, secures lasting impact. When persecution arises (as it did for Daniel), believers must trust God's protection, knowing that steadfast loyalty to Him, even when others seek to destroy one's faith, becomes a testament to divine sovereignty. Crucially, Calvin connects Daniel's trial to Christ: just as Daniel was preserved in the lions' den by divine intervention, Christ endured the ultimate \"lions\" (death) through obedience to the Father. Daniel's faithfulness thus prefigures Christ's triumph, teaching believers that Christ's victory over sin and death is secured through divine provision in the midst of human opposition, urging Christians to remain unshaken in their allegiance despite earthly pressures.

The princes' conspiracy to undermine Daniel centers on his faith, crafting an unalterable decree that punished worship of any god besides the king, a move Poole identifies as deeply idolatrous, aiming to deify Darius while violating natural order. Daniel's response—praying three times daily facing Jerusalem—demonstrates unwavering devotion, a practice Poole links to Solomon's temple worship and Christ as the true \"holy of holies,\" where God's presence and acceptance are realized. Theologically, this highlights how true worship transcends political power, with Daniel's faith positioning Christ as the sole source of salvation and authority, surpassing all earthly rulers. Practically, Daniel's example instructs believers to maintain consistent, humble worship despite political pressure or persecution, refusing to compromise their faith for temporary favor. Poole emphasizes that Daniel's survival in the lions' den signifies God's protection for those who prioritize Him over worldly systems, foreshadowing Christ's triumph over sin and death. For modern Christians, this underscores the courage to stand firm in Christ amidst cultural or political demands that threaten authentic worship, knowing that faithful obedience to God—like Daniel's prayer toward Jerusalem—ensures divine deliverance and ultimate victory, as Christ is the only true Temple where God dwells and accepts the redeemed.

Barnes engages with objections from scholars like Bertholdt and Bleek, arguing that the decree's plausibility hinges on understanding Persian royal ideology, where kings were culturally regarded as divine incarnations (Ormuzd) and could reasonably issue such commands to assert absolute authority over subjects who worshipped multiple deities. This theological insight reveals God's sovereignty over human political structures and His ability to protect faithful individuals within oppressive systems, as Daniel remains unharmed despite the king's decree. Practically, this encourages believers to maintain trust in God's protection when facing unjust political or religious pressures, avoiding futile rebellion while holding fast to divine truth. Crucially, Barnes connects Daniel's story to Christ: just as Daniel refused to defile himself with idolatrous practices by persisting in his faith, Christ himself submitted to human authority (the cross) while maintaining ultimate allegiance to the Father, demonstrating that true obedience to God transcends earthly power structures. This chapter thus provides a powerful model for Christian resilience—remaining steadfast in divine truth without compromising moral integrity, even when the world's systems demand compromise, thereby reflecting Christ's sacrificial obedience to the Father's will.

After learning from Jeremiah that Jerusalem's desolation would last seventy years, Daniel urgently turned to God in repentance, confessing Israel's collective sin—rebelliousness against God's law, disobedience to prophets, and spiritual blindness—while pleading for mercy and restoration. His prayer reveals a theological insight: true repentance requires acknowledging both personal and communal failure, recognizing God's righteousness and mercy as inseparable, and appealing not to mere promises but to God's character. Crucially, Henry highlights how this prayer triggers a divine revelation of Christ's coming: the \"seventy weeks\" prophecy points not to a future Jewish messiah but to Christ's atoning sacrifice, fulfilled in the crucifixion where sin's debt is paid once for all. This Christ connection shows that Daniel's prayer, though rooted in historical lament, anticipates the ultimate redemption through Jesus—the one who \"makes full atonement for sin\" and restores the \"holy mountain\" (the church). Practically, Henry urges believers to emulate Daniel's earnest confession and persistent prayer, understanding that God's mercy is always available when we humble ourselves before Him.

Calvin stresses that true prayer requires humility before God's greatness, confessed sinfulness, and trust in His covenant mercy, as Daniel explicitly sought pardon for his people's failures. This chapter illustrates a critical theological truth: God's redemptive plan unfolds through human repentance and divine intervention, where the \"seventy weeks\" (Daniel 9:24) ultimately point to Christ's atoning work. Calvin connects Daniel's prayer to Christ's fulfillment, noting that the seventy years of desolation symbolically foreshadow Christ's 430 days of redemption (the \"seventy weeks\" in Daniel 9:24-27), where the \"messenger of the covenant\" (Christ) brings restoration through atonement. Practically, Calvin urges believers to examine their own spiritual dryness: in a world of distraction and self-reliance, true prayer must involve humble confession, repentance, and reliance on Christ's finished work—not ritualistic compliance. Modern readers should seek God with the same earnestness Daniel displayed, recognizing that God's mercy is secured only through Christ's sacrifice, not human effort.

        "quote": "Matthew Poole's commentary on Daniel 9 emphasizes Daniel's profound humility and scriptural engagement during the Jewish exile. In the first year of Darius the Mede (not the Persian king), Daniel confesses the people's sins—specifically their rebellion against God's laws, rejection of prophets, and failure to heed covenant promises—before praying for restoration. Poole highlights Daniel's authentic repentance: he acknowledges sin with naked honesty, sets himself among the greatest sinners, and appeals to God's covenant mercy while recognizing divine justice. Theologically, Poole underscores that God's covenant remains active despite human rebellion, revealing His character as both just and merciful. Crucially, Gabriel's revelation of the 70 weeks (Daniel 9:20-27) directly points to Christ—the Messiah's coming, death, and the subsequent tribulation period—demonstrating how God's ancient promises find fulfillment in Jesus. This Christ connection transforms the chapter: the 70 weeks are not a historical footnote but a divine timetable for redemption. Practically, Poole's insight calls believers to examine their sins without defensiveness, embrace humble prayer as a means of accessing God's mercy, and trust Christ as the fulfillment of the prophetic timeline. True repentance, as Daniel models, involves both confession of sin and active seeking of God's restoration—revealing that even in our failures, Christ's sacrifice secures mercy and hope, urging us to live in covenant faith despite our rebellion.

        "quote": "Albert Barnes's commentary on Daniel 9 reveals a profound theological narrative where Daniel's personal crisis becomes a universal model for faith. In the first year of Darius, Daniel studied Jeremiah and discerned the seventy-year exile prophesied for Jerusalem, then urgently prayed for restoration—his fervent plea rooted in the conviction that divine timing was near. His prayer (9:4-19) stands as a powerful testament to confession: he openly acknowledged the nation's deserved punishment, demonstrating that true prayer arises from repentance when divine discipline is evident. The angel's subsequent message (9:20-27) resolves the chapter's tension by revealing the seventy weeks prophecy (490 years) as a divine schedule culminating not in temple restoration but in Christ's arrival. Barnes emphasizes that this \"anointing\" (9:21) points directly to Jesus—the Messiah who fulfills the prophecy by atoning for sin, establishing God's eternal kingdom, and ultimately destroying the temple's physical structure through his work. Theologically, this shows how Old Testament prophecies are Christ-centered, designed to reveal God's redemptive plan through human suffering. Practically, Daniel's journey teaches believers to pray with urgency when God's timing seems near, confess sin without delay, and trust that divine promises—however distant they appear—point to Christ's ultimate fulfillment. In a world of uncertainty, this encourages active repentance, persistent prayer, and hope that Christ's coming resolves all temporal desolation, transforming suffering into eternal restoration through his sacrifice.

Henry highlights that Daniel's profound weakness—his \"corruption\" and \"no strength\"—mirrors the human condition, yet the heavenly messenger, described with luminous glory (\"face as lightning,\" \"voice like a multitude\"), directly points to Christ the divine ruler who would triumph over earthly powers. This figure, identified by Henry as Christ appearing in glory to Daniel, underscores a key Christ connection: the \"man like the sons of men\" who will \"fight with the prince of Persia\" (v. 20) is Christ himself, who defeats Satan and his forces, establishing God's eternal purposes. Theologically, Henry stresses that God's response to Daniel's earnest seeking—his \"words were heard\" and the angel's visitation—affirms that true communion with God requires humility and surrender, as Daniel's \"sorrows turned upon him\" yet he was \"strengthened\" through divine encounter. Practically, this commentary urges believers to cultivate deep dependence on Christ when facing spiritual battles, recognizing that God's strength is available even in weakness and that persistent prayer—like Daniel's mourning for three weeks—can unlock divine intervention. Henry concludes that Christ's victory over all opposition, secured through the faithful Michael (a clear prefiguration of Christ's heavenly army), offers enduring hope: the \"whole counsel of God shall be established,\" inviting believers to rest in Christ as their \"righteousness now\" and \"everlasting confidence.\" (248 words)",

He interprets Daniel's declaration that \"the thing was true, but the time appointed was long\" as a divine assurance of prophecy's certainty despite delayed fulfillment—a crucial reminder that God's promises remain firm even when human expectations face prolonged waiting. Calvin notes Daniel's three-week mourning period as a deliberate act of spiritual discipline, reflecting his deep sorrow over the interruption of temple rebuilding under Cyrus' son, Cambyses. This period of fasting and self-denial, Calvin argues, demonstrates how faithful individuals must cultivate patience and humility when God's timing diverges from human urgency. Theologically, Calvin connects Daniel's struggle with the angelic conflict described in the chapter to Christ's future ministry: the \"long time\" signifies the period before Christ's atoning work, where divine authority prevails over opposing forces. Practically, Calvin urges believers to embrace patient endurance in all promises—whether biblical prophecies, personal trials, or spiritual growth—avoiding impatience that rushes toward premature conclusions. This discipline mirrors Christ's own submission to the cross, where suffering precedes ultimate victory. For modern readers, Calvin's insight highlights that true hope rests not in speed but in trust: just as Daniel waited for God's decisive action, believers must cultivate inner stillness and self-sacrifice when promises seem delayed, understanding that Christ's victory—fully realized in the cross and resurrection—ultimately fulfills all divine purposes.

        "quote": "Poole's commentary on Daniel chapter 10 emphasizes Daniel's profound humility and divine encounter as the chapter's core. Daniel, mourning the Jewish people's plight and fasting for three weeks, experiences a vision where a luminous figure—described with beryl-like body, lightning face, and fire-like eyes—appears. Poole interprets this figure not as an angel but as the pre-incarnate Christ, revealing his triune roles as King, Priest, and Prophet through his majestic yet approachable presence. This vision, Poole argues, is a crucial prelude to Daniel 11–12, explicitly foreshadowing Christ's future ministry and the three-hundred-year tribulation period. Theologically, Poole highlights the figure's divine authority and the terror of encountering Christ's glory, as seen in Daniel's physical collapse and trembling. Practically, this passage underscores the necessity of humility and spiritual preparation: true revelation comes to those who mourn, fast, and surrender to God's will, as Daniel did. The angel Gabriel's subsequent command—\"O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words\"—affirms that God's revelation is both accessible to the humble and transformative, requiring steadfast faith. Poole's insight connects this vision directly to Christ's identity and mission, showing how Daniel's experience prefigures the Messiah's coming and the divine assurance that Christ, though seemingly distant, is the ultimate source of salvation and truth for God's people. This passage thus challenges believers to cultivate humility in suffering and trust in Christ's sovereign presence amid uncertainty. (248 words)",

        "quote": "Albert Barnes's commentary on Daniel 10 reveals this chapter as a pivotal, though seemingly introductory, revelation occurring in the third year of Cyrus, when Daniel fasted at Passover by the Tigris. The vision centers on an angelic figure clad in linen and gold, who after overcoming Daniel's initial prostration, explains that Daniel's prayer had been heard but delayed for twenty-one days by the \"prince of the kingdom of Persia\" (a cosmic force representing opposition) until Michael, a high-ranking heavenly warrior, intervened to secure the revelation. Barnes emphasizes that this encounter demonstrates God's sovereign governance amid human and spiritual conflict, where divine timing defies human expectations—here, the \"long\" period signifying extended trials and warfare. Theologically, this underscores that true revelation emerges through persistent prayer and divine intervention, not human effort alone. Crucially, Barnes connects this to Christ: the \"prince of Persia\" likely symbolizes Satan's opposition, while Michael's role prefigures Christ's victory over spiritual adversaries. Daniel's prostration mirrors Christ's humility, and the angel's promise to \"fight\" echoes Christ's ultimate triumph over sin and death. Practically, this calls believers to maintain steadfast prayer during prolonged trials, understand that God's timing is purposeful even when seemingly delayed, and recognize that spiritual warfare is ongoing—encouraging reliance on heavenly intercessors and Christ's ultimate victory. The chapter thus anchors hope in God's faithfulness amid chaos, urging perseverance through the \"long warfare\" until Christ's return. (278 words)",

The prophecy vividly depicts the violent conflicts and eventual collapse of worldly rulers, emphasizing that human empires rise and fall due to human ambition, while God remains unchanging in His purpose. Theologically, Henry underscores that this narrative affirms God's absolute control over history: all kingdoms, wars, and political upheavals are part of His divine plan, demonstrating that nothing earthly can withstand His ultimate authority. Critically, Henry connects the \"abomination of desolation\" (v. 31) to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ—where the true \"branch\" (v. 7) overcomes all enemies, establishes God's kingdom, and fulfills the prophecy's promise of a holy covenant. Practically, this commentary urges believers to reject worldly power structures and political chaos by anchoring their lives in Christ. In a world rife with division and persecution, faithful Christians are called to remain steadfast, knowing that God's kingdom is not of this age but of eternal significance. The practical application is clear: when chaos reigns, trust in Christ's authority as the only enduring hope, rather than seeking security in transient political systems. Henry stresses that true victory comes through Christ's resurrection power, enabling believers to stand firm against opposition and await the final restoration of God's kingdom—a promise that transcends temporal empires and secures eternal peace.

He stresses that angels act exclusively as instruments of God's will, never claiming independent authority—highlighting that the angel's \"boast\" in strengthening Darius was merely God's delegated action to preserve Israel. Theologically, Calvin sees this prophecy as a divine assurance that God actively safeguards His people amidst worldly chaos, ensuring His covenant promises endure despite political upheaval. Crucially, Calvin connects Daniel's \"fourth king\" (Xerxes) to Christ: the ultimate fulfillment of this prophecy lies in Jesus, who as the \"King of Kings\" conquers all earthly powers through divine authority rather than human wealth or military might. Practically, this teaching urges believers to reject political idolatry and earthly ambitions, trusting God's sovereignty in turbulent times. It calls for humility in the face of historical cycles—recognizing that true strength comes from Christ, who \"stirs up all against the realm of Grecia\" (the world powers) yet establishes an eternal kingdom that transcends human conflict.

Poole identifies the sequence of kings—Cyrus, Smerdis, Darius, and Xerxes—followed by Alexander the Great, whose conquests and subsequent kingdom fragmentation fulfill the text's description of a \"mighty king\" whose dominion is broken into four parts. He then traces the Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires, highlighting the tragic political alliance between Ptolemy Philadelphus and Antiochus Theus through the marriage of Bernice, which ultimately led to mutual betrayal and violence. Theologically, Poole underscores that this prophecy reveals God's purpose in history: the ultimate triumph of His people over earthly powers, as the \"one who stands up\" (Daniel 11:7) refers not to a human ruler but to Christ himself, who will decisively overcome the \"king of the north\" and all opposing forces. This perspective affirms that historical conflicts, however chaotic, are part of God's providence to prepare for Christ's return. Practically, believers are called to discern God's sovereignty in current geopolitical tensions, avoiding the pitfalls of human alliances and political ambition that the prophecy warns against.

Theologically, this reveals God's sovereign orchestration of world history—using seemingly chaotic political shifts to advance His redemptive purpose. Crucially, Barnes connects Antiochus Epiphanes' violent suppression of Jewish religious practices to the ultimate enemy of Christ, foreshadowing the final conflict where Christ will conquer all opposition. Practically, this commentary urges believers to view current trials not as isolated crises but as part of a larger narrative where God's sovereignty ensures ultimate victory. Just as Daniel received assurance of deliverance amid impending chaos, Christians today can anchor their hope in Christ's promised return, knowing that God's faithful intervention will overcome all present struggles and secure eternal restoration.

The \"time of trouble\" described is not a historical event but the ultimate tribulation preceding Christ's return, where God's deliverance ensures only the elect—those \"written in the book\"—are saved.
