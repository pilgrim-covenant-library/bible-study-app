Its principal subject is to discover the purposes of God concerning the affairs of the church, and of the nations as connected therewith, to the end of the world. These events would surely come to pass; and they would begin to come to pass very shortly. Though Christ is himself God, and has light and , yet, as Mediator between God and man, he receives instructions from the Father. To him we owe the knowledge of what we are to expect from God, and what he expects from us. The subject of this revelation was, the things that must shortly come to pass. On all who read or hear the words of the prophecy, a blessing is pronounced. Those are well employed who search the Bible. It is not enough that we read and hear, but we must keep the things that are written, in our memories, in our minds, in our affections, , and we shall be deed. Even the mysteries and difficulties of this book are united with discoveries of God, suited to impress the mind with awe, and to purify the soul of the reader, though he may not discern the prophetic meaning.",

To enter into an extended investigation of this would greatly exceed the limits which I have, and would not comport with my notes. For a full examination of the question I must refer to others, and would mention particularly, Prof. Stuart, Com. i. -283-427; Lardner, Works, vi. 318-327; Hug, Introduction to the New Testament, pp. 650-673, Andover, 1836; Michaelis, Introduction to the New Testament, iv. 457-544; and the article \"Revelation,\" in Kitto's Cyclopaedia of Biblical Literature. I propose to exhibit, briefly, the evidence that the apostle John was the author, according to the opinion which has been commonly church; the proof of which seems to me to be satisfactory. This may be considered under these divisions: the direct historical evidence, and the insufficiency of the reason for doubting it. I. The Direct Historical Evidence The sum of all that is to be said on this point is, that to the latter half of the third century it was not doubted that the apostle John was the author. Why it was ever doubted after that, and what is the force and value of the doubt, will be part of this Introduction. There may be some the early historical testimony into three periods of half a century each, extending from the death of John, about 98 a. d. , to the middle of the third century. From the Death of JOHN, about 98 a.",

See the Introduction. In regard to the nature of these visions, or the state of mind of the writer, there have been different opinions. Some have supposed that all that is described was made only to pass before the mind, with no visible representation; others, that there were visible representations so made to him that he could copy them; others, that all that is said or seen was only the production of the author's imagination. The latter is the view principally entertained by German writers on the book. All that would seem to be apparent on the face of the book - and that is all that we can judge by - is, that the following things occurred: (1) The writer devout frame of mind - a state of holy contemplation - when the scenes were represented to him, Revelation 1:10. (2) the representations were supernatural; that is, they were something which was disclosed to him, in that state of mind, beyond any natural reach of his faculties. (3) these things were so made to pass before him that they had the aspect of reality, and he could copy and describe them as real.",

This represented the secret purposes of God about to be revealed. The designs and methods of Divine Providence, toward the church and the world, are stated, fixed, and made a matter of record. The counsels of God are altogether hidden from the eye and understanding of the creature. The several parts are not unsealed and opened at once, but after each other, till the whole mystery of God's counsel and conduct is world. The creatures cannot open it, nor read it; the Lord only can do so. Those who see most of God, are most desirous to see more; and those who have seen his glory, desire to know his will. But even good men may be too eager and hasty to look into the mysteries of the Divine conduct. Such desires, if not soon answered, turn to grief and sorrow. If John wept much because he could not look into the book of God's decrees, what reason have many to shed floods of tears for their ignorance of the gospel of Christ! of that on which everlasting salvation depends! We need not weep that we cannot foresee future events respecting world; the eager expectation of future prospects, or the foresight of future calamities, would alike unfit us for present duties and conflicts, or render our prosperous days distressing.",

It is manner eminently suited to impress the mind with a sense of the importance of the revelations about to be made. The proper state of mind for appreciating this chapter is that when we look on the future, and are sensible that important events are about to occur; when we feel that that future is wholly impenetrable to us; and when the efforts of the highest created minds fail to lift the mysterious veil which hides those events from our view; it with our nature that the mind should be impressed with solemn awe under such circumstances; it is not a violation of the laws of our nature that one who had an earnest desire to penetrate that future, and who saw the volume before him which contained the mysterious revelation, and who yet felt that there was no or earth who could break the seals, and disclose what was to come, should weep. Compare Revelation 5:4. The design of the whole chapter is evidently to honor the Lamb of God, by showing that the power was entrusted to him which was confided to no one or earth, of disclosing what is to come. Nothing else would better illustrate this than the fact that he alone could break the mysterious seals which barred out the knowledge of the future from all created eyes; and nothing would be better adapted to impress this on the mind than the chapter - the exhibition of a mysterious hand of God; the proclamation of the angel, calling on any who could do it to open the book; the fact that no or earth could do it; the tears shed by John when it was found that no one could do it; the assurance of one of the elders that the Lion of the tribe of Judah had power to do it; and the profound adoration of , , and under the of the power entrusted to him of breaking these mysterious seals.",

Revelation 6:1-17 The opening of six of the , and what followed thereupon. Chapter Introduction We are now come to the prophetical, and therefore the most difficult, part of this mysterious book; as to which I judge it reasonable, before we come to open the mysterious text, (after Mr. Pool's Latin Synopsis), to premise some things which may instruct the reader of these notes, both of the things in which the difficulties lie, and of the fair way to find out the sense of them. Hitherto we have met with no great difficulties; what have been, have been chiefly: 1. Concerning the seven Spirits of God. Concerning the seven churches, and epistles to them; whether the churches be to be considered typically, and what was written to them be to be prophetic, as well as a didactic, or a corrective sense? follows we shall find great (if not some inextricable) difficulties. To prepare a way for the explication of which: 1. I shall first take it for granted, that from this chapter to the end of the book, is revealed the most remarkable things which have happened, or shall happen, to the church of God over all the earth, from the time of this Revelation first made to John, to the end of the world. Hence it follows, that many of the things prophesied are fulfilled; but how many is hard to determine, because the time is not set when these revelations should take place; whether (as some would have it) from the beginning of Christianity, which, to me, seemes not probable; because at this time ninety-five years were elapsed since that time, and this prophecy was concerning the things that were to be after the time of John's , Revelation 1:1 22:6; or from the beginning of the time when the Jewish church and state ceased, which was twenty-six or twenty-seven years before this; or from the time when this Revelation was, which was Anno 95, or thereabouts, in the time when Domitian was the Roman emperor, and had began his persecution of the Christians, which (as historians tell us) was but five years before he was slain, for he was , 97.",

It need hardly be said to anyone who is at all familiar with the numerous - not to say numberless - expositions of the Apocalypse, that it is at this point that interpreters begin to differ, and that here commences the divergence toward those various, discordant, and many of them wild and fantastic theories, which have been exposition of this wonderful book. Up to this point, though there may be unimportant exposition of words and phrases, there is no material difference of opinion as to the general meaning of the writer. In the epistles to the seven churches, introductory scenes to the main visions, there can be no doubt, in the main, as to what the writer , and what he meant to describe. He addressed churches then existing Revelation 1; Revelation 3, and set before them their sins and their duties; and he described scenes passing before his eyes as then present Revelation 4-5, which were merely designed to impress his own mind with the importance of what was to be disclosed, and to bring the great actors on the stage, to which there could be little ground for interpretation. Here, however, the scene opens into the future, comprehending all the unknown period until there shall be a final triumph of Christianity, and all its foes shall be prostrate. The actors are the Son of God, angels, people, Satan, storms, tempests, earthquakes, the pestilence and fire; the scene is heaven, earth, hell.",

But the destruction is delayed. Seals were used to mark for each person his own possessions. This mark is the witness of the Holy Ghost, hearts of believers. And the Lord would not suffer his people to be afflicted before they were marked, that they might be prepared against all conflicts.

The number of those who were sealed, may be understood to stand for the remnant of people which God reserved. Though the church of God is but a little flock, in comparison with the wicked world, yet it is a society really large, and to be still more enlarged.

This is symbolized by four angels four quarters of the earth, and holding the winds and the storms that they should not blow on the earth until the servants of God should be foreheads. The idea is that of sudden destruction about to burst on the world, which, if unrestrained, would apparently bring on the consummation of all things, but which is held back until the purposes of to his people shall be accomplished - that is, until those who are the true servants of God shall be designated by some appropriate mark. This furnishes an opportunity of disclosing a glorious vision of those who will be saved, alike among the Jews and the Gentiles. The fact, as symbol, is, that the end of the world does not come at the opening of the sixth seal, as it seemed as if it would, and as it was time of the consternation.

These circumstances retard the course of the action, and fix the mind on a new order of events - events which could be appropriately grouped together, and which, for some reason, might be thus more appropriately represented than they could many successive seals. What was the reason of this arrangement will be more readily seen on an examination of the particular events referred successive trumpet-blasts. The chapter are the following: (1) The opening of the seventh seal, Revelation 8:1. This is attended, not with an immediate exhibition of the events which are to occur, case of the former seals, but with a solemn for the space of half an hour. The reason of this silence, apparently, is solemn nature of the events which are anticipated.",

Having ceased to be a minister of Christ, he who is represented by this star becomes the minister of the devil; and lets loose the powers of hell against the churches of Christ. On the opening of the bottomless pit, there arose a great smoke. The devil carries on his designs by blinding the eyes of men, by putting out light and knowledge, and promoting ignorance and error. Out of this smoke there came a swarm of locusts, emblems of the devil's agents, who promote superstition, idolatry, error, and cruelty. The trees and the grass, the true believers, whether young or more advanced, should be untouched. But a secret poison and soul, should rob many others of purity, and afterwards of peace. The locusts had no power to hurt those who had the seal of God. God's all-powerful, distinguishing grace will keep his people from total and final apostacy. The power is limited to a short season; but it would be very sharp. In such events the faithful share the common calamity, but from the pestilence of error they might and would be safe. We collect from Scripture, that such errors were to try and prove the Christians, 1Co 11:19. And early writers plainly refer this to the first great host of corrupters who overspread the Christian church.",

And I saw a star fall from heaven to the earth: what this star falling from heaven means, is not easy to resolve. Those who think it the devil, once a star, but fallen, forget that John is not here told a story of what beginning of the world, but what should be, and that five hundred years after Christ's coming. And the same reason holds against those who think those seditious persons are meant, who did so much about Jerusalem during the siege; this had been to have revealed to John those things which he knew were done many years before. Amongst those who think some particular eminent minister of the church, who apostatized, is meant, those seem to me to judge better, who think that Boniface the Third is meant, who, in the year 606, obtained the privilege of the pope's supremacy, than those who understand it of Arius or Pelagius, who both of them fell two hundred years before this.",

The three extend, as I suppose, to the end of time, or, as it is supposed by the writer himself Revelation 11:15, to the period when \"the kingdoms of this world shall have become the kingdoms of Christ,\" embracing a succinct view of the most material events that were to occur, secular point of view. See the Analysis prefixed to the book. In Revelation 11:19, as I understand it, a new view is commenced, referring to the church internally; the rise of Antichrist, and the effect of the rise of that formidable power on the internal history of the church, to the time of its overthrow, and the triumphant establishment of the kingdom of God. This, of course, beginning and its close with the portion already passed over, but with a different view. See the Analysis prefixed to Revelation 11:19 ff. This chapter Revelation 9 contains properly three parts. First, a description of the first of those trumpets, or the order of the whole, Revelation 9:1-12. This woe is represented under the figure of calamities brought upon the earth by an immense army of locusts. A star is seen to fall from heaven representing some mighty chieftain, and to him is given the key of the bottomless pit. He opens the pit, and then comes forth an innumerable swarm of locusts that darken the heavens, and they go forth upon the earth.",

Chapter Introduction We have former chapters Christ's revelation to St. John of what should Roman empire under the first six seals, that is, during their pagan state, which 's time, Anno 310, or 325. Under the seventh seal he has revealed to him what should happen after that time to the Roman empire by the Goths and Vandals under the first four trumpets, and by the Saracens under the fifth trumpet, and the Turks under the sixth trumpet, who are yet rampant and going outrages. The seventh should sound next, but we come not to that till Revelation 11:15. In this chapter, and to the 15th verse of the next chapter, seems an interruption of the history, that Christ might reveal to his prophet the main things that should concern his church. About the sense of this interpreters are divided, some thinking this a distinct prophecy relating to the affairs of the church, yet continued story, but made up of several visions, some contemporary with the times before mentioned, some continuing to the time after the sixth trumpet; which prophecy, as they judge, beginns at Revelation 11:1, to which what we chapter is introductive.",

The vision is interposed between the sounding of the sixth, or second woe-trumpet, and the sounding of the seventh, or third woe-trumpet, under which is to be the final consummation, Revelation 11:15 ff. It occupies an important interval between the events which were to occur under the sixth trumpet and the last scene - the final overthrow of the formidable power which had opposed the reign of God on the earth, and the reign of righteousness, when the kingdoms of the world shall become the kingdom of God, Revelation 11:15. It is, in many respects, an unhappy circumstance that this chapter has been separated from the following. They constitute one continued vision, at least to Revelation 11:15, where the sounding of the seventh and last trumpet occurs. The tenth chapter contains the following things: (1) An angel descends from heaven, and the attention of the seer is for a time turned from the contemplation of what was to this new vision that appeared on the earth. This angel is clothed with a cloud; he is encircled by a rainbow; his face is as the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire - all indicating his exalted rank, and all such accompaniments as became a heavenly messenger. (2) the angel appears with a small hand, Revelation 10:2. This book is not closed and sealed, like the 5:1-14, but was \"open\" - so that it could be read.",

The measuring of the temple, Revelation 11:1-2. A reed, or measuring-stick, is given to John, and he is directed to arise and measure the temple. This direction embraces two parts: (a) he was to measure, that; is, to take an exact estimate of the temple, of the altar, and of the true worshippers; (b) he was carefully to separate this, in his estimate, from the outward court, which was to be left out and to be given to the Gentiles, to be trodden under foot forty-two months; that is, three years and a half, or twelve hundred and sixty days - a period book of Daniel as well book. II. The two witnesses, Revelation 11:3-13. This is, in some respects, the most difficult portion of the Book of Revelation, and its meaning can be stated only after a careful examination of the signification of the words and phrases used. The general to these witnesses is, that they should have power, and should prophesy for twelve hundred and sixty days; that if anyone should attempt to injure them, they had power, by fire that proceeded out of their mouths, to devour and kill their enemies; that they had power to shut heaven so that it should not rain, and power to turn the waters of the earth into blood, and power to smite the earth with plagues as often as they chose; that when they had completed their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit would make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them; that their dead bodies would lie great city where the Lord was crucified three days and a half; that they that dwelt upon the earth would death, and send gifts to one of their joy; that after the three days and a half the spirit of life from God would enter into them again, and they would stand up on their feet; that they would then be taken up into heaven, in the sight of their enemies; and that, at the time of their ascension, there would be a great earthquake, and a tenth part of the city would fall, and many (seven thousand) would be killed, and that the remainder would be affrighted, and would give glory to the God of heaven.",

It was a frightful monster! It appears to mean that worldly, oppressing dominion, which for many ages, even from the times of the Babylonish captivity, had been hostile to the church. The first beast then began to oppress and persecute the righteous for righteousness' sake, but they suffered most under the fourth beast of Daniel, (the Roman empire,) which has afflicted the saints with many cruel persecutions. The source of its power was the dragon. It was set up by the devil, and supported by him. The wounding the head may be the abolishing pagan idolatry; and the healing of the wound, introducing popish idolatry, the , new dress, but which as effectually answers the devil's design. The world admired its power, policy and success. They paid honour and subjection to the devil and his instruments. It exercised infernal power and policy, requiring men to render that honour to creatures which belongs to God alone. Yet the devil's power and success are limited. Christ has a chosen remnant, redeemed by his blood, book, sealed by his Spirit; and though the devil and antichrist may overcome the body, and take away the natural life, they cannot conquer the soul, nor prevail with true believers to forsake their Saviour, and join his enemies.",

The chapter is of two distinct \"beasts,\" each with special characteristics, yet closely related, deriving their power from a common source; aiding each accomplishment of the same object, and manifestly relating to the same power under different forms.

The Characteristics Of The Beasts A. \"The characteristics of the first beast,\" Revelation 13:1-10.

(b) It has seven heads and ten horns, and upon its horns ten crowns or diadems, Revelation 13:1. (c) In its general form it resembles a leopard; its feet are like those of a bear; its mouth like that of a lion. Its connection with the great \"dragon\" - with Satan - is indicated by the statement that it derives its \"power, and its seat, and its authority\" from him Revelation 13:2 - a striking representation of the fact that the civil or secular Roman power which supported the church of Rome through all its corrupt and bloody progress was the putting forth of the power of Satan on the earth.",

It was proper that this gloomy picture should be relieved, and accordingly this chapter, having much of the aspect of an episode, is comfort the hearts of those who should see those troublous times. There were bright scenes beyond, and it was important to direct the eye to them, that the hearts of the sad might be consoled. This chapter, therefore, contains a succession of symbolical representations designed to show the ultimate result of all these things - \"to hold out the symbols of ultimate and certain victory\" (Prof. Stuart). Those symbols are the following: (1) The vision of the hundred and forty-four thousand on Mount Zion, as emblematical of the final triumph of the redeemed, Revelation 14:1-5. They have the Father's foreheads Revelation 14:1; they sing a song of victory Revelation 14:2-3; they are found without fault before God - representatives, in this respect, of all that will be saved, Revelation 14:4-5. (2) the vision of the final triumph of the gospel, Revelation 14:6-7. An angel is seen midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to all that dwell upon the earth, and announcing that the end is near - a representation designed to show that the gospel will be thus preached among all nations; and when that is done, the time will draw on when the affairs of the world will be wound up.",

And I heard a great voice out of the temple; either out of the church triumphant, Christ, the Head of it, commanding the executioners of his justice to go and do their office; or out of the church militant, by their prayers soliciting God to execute vengeance upon the beast.

All is now ready; and this chapter contains the description of those seven last \"plagues\" under which this power would reel and fall. These \"plagues\" are described as if they were a succession of physical calamities that would come upon this anti-Christian power, and bring it to an end; though perhaps it is not necessary to look for a literal infliction of such calamities. The course of the exposition thus far will lead us to regard this chapter as a description of the successive blows by which the papacy will fall. A part of this is still undoubtedly future, though perhaps not far distant; and, in reference to this, and to some portions of the remainder of the book, there may be more the mind portions which pertain to past events. The chapter comprises statements on the following points: A command is issued from the temple to the seven angels, to go and execute the commission with which they were entrusted, Revelation 16:1. The first angel pours out his vial upon the earth followed by a plague upon those who had worshipped the beast and his image, Revelation 16:2. The second angel pours out his vial upon the sea - followed by the death of all that sea, Revelation 16:3. The third angel pours out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters, and they become blood.",

Pagan Rome subdued and ruled with military power, not by are and flatteries. She left the to their ancient usages and worship. But it is well known that by crafty and politic management, with all kinds of deceit of unrighteousness, papal Rome has obtained and kept her rule over kings and nations. Here were allurements of worldly honour and riches, pomp and pride, suited to sensual and worldly minds. Prosperity, pomp, and splendour, feed the pride and lusts of the human heart, but are no security against the Divine vengeance. The golden cup represents the allurements, and delusions, by which this mystical Babylon has obtained and kept her influence, and seduced others to join her abominations. She is named, from her infamous practices, a mother of harlots; training them up to idolatry and all sorts of wickedness. She filled herself with the blood of the saints and martyrs of Jesus. She intoxicated herself with it; and it was so pleasant to her, that she never was satisfied. We cannot but wonder at the oceans of Christian blood shed by men called Christians; yet when we consider these prophecies, these awful deeds testify to the truth of the gospel. And let all beware of a splendid, gainful, or fashionable religion.",

A whore properly signifies one that is married, and is false to her husband's bed; and so very well suits the Church of Rome, (if they yet deserve that name), whose faith was formerly spoken of throughout the world, Romans 1:8, but is long since turned idolatrous (idolatry, in the prophetic style, being quite through the Scripture called whoredom).

It contains an account of the sequel of the pouring out of the last vial, and the description, in various forms, continues to the close of Revelation 19. The whole of this description Revelation 17-19 constitutes the last great catastrophe represented under the seventh vial Revelation 16:17-21, at the close of which the great enemy of God and the church will be destroyed, and the church will be triumphant, Revelation 19:17-21. The chapter is that of a harlot, or abandoned woman, on whom severe judgment is brought for her sins. The action is here delayed, and this chapter has much the appearance of an explanatory episode, designed to give a more clear and definite idea of the character of that formidable anti-Christian power on which the judgment was to descend. The chapter, without any formal division, embraces the following points: (1) Introduction, Revelation 17:1-3. One of the seven angels entrusted with the seven vials comes to John, saying that he would describe to him the judgment that was to come upon the great harlot with whom the kings of the earth had committed fornication, and who had made the dwellers upon the earth drunk by the wine of her fornication - that is, of that anti-Christian power so often referred book, which by its influence had deluded the nations, and brought their rulers under its control.",

The chapter is that of a rich merchant-city reduced to desolation, and is but carrying out the general idea under a different form. The chapter comprises the following points: (1) Another angel is seen descending from heaven, having great power, and making proclamation that Babylon the great is fallen, and is become utterly desolate, Revelation 18:1-3. (2) a warning voice is heard from heaven, calling on the people of God to come out of her, and to be partakers neither of her sins nor her plagues. Her torment and sorrow would be proportionate to her pride and luxury; and her plagues would come upon her suddenly; death, and mourning, and famine, and consumption by fire, Revelation 18:4-8. (3) lamentation over her fall - by those especially who had been connected with her; who had been corrupted by her; who had been profited by her, Revelation 18:9-19; (a) By kings, Revelation 18:9-10. They had lived deliciously with her, and they would lament her. (b) By merchants, Revelation 18:11-17. They had trafficked with her, but now that traffic was to cease, and no man would buy of her. Their business, so far as she was concerned, was at an end. All that she had accumulated was now to be destroyed; all her gathered riches were to be consumed; all the things by which she had been enriched was to be ended; and the city that was more than all others enriched by these things, as if linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls, was to be destroyed forever.",

There is harmony between the angels and the triumphant song. Christ is the Bridegroom of his ransomed church. This second union will be ; but the beginning of the glorious millennium (by which is meant a reign of Christ, or a state of happiness, for a thousand years on earth) may be considered as the celebration of his espousals on earth. Then the church of Christ, being purified from errors, divisions, and corruptions, in doctrine, discipline, worship, and practice, will be made ready to be publicly owned by him as his delight and his beloved. The church appeared; gay, gaudy dress of the mother of harlots, linen, clean and white. In the robes of Christ's righteousness, imputed for justification, and imparted for sanctification. The promises of the gospel, the true sayings of God, opened, applied, and sealed by the Spirit of God, in holy ordinances, are the marriage-feast. This seems to refer to the abundant grace and consolation Christians will happy days which are to come. The apostle offered honour to the angel. The angel refused it. He directed the apostle to the true and only object of religious worship; to worship God, and him alone. This plainly condemns the practice of those who worship the elements of bread and wine, and saints, and angels; and of those who do not believe that Christ is truly and by nature God, yet pay him a sort of worship.",

The chapter consists of the following parts: I. A hymn of the heavenly of the destruction of the mystical Babylon, Revelation 19:1-7; (a) A voice is shouting Hallelujah, in view of the fact that God had judged the great harlot that had corrupted the earth, Revelation 19:1-2. (b) The sound is echoed and repeated as the smoke of her torment ascends, Revelation 19:3. (c) The four and twenty elders, and the four living creatures, as that pertains to the church, shout of Hallelujah, Revelation 19:4. (d) A voice is heard from the throne commanding them to praise God, Revelation 19:5; and, (e) the mighty shout of Hallelujah is echoed and repeated from unnumbered hosts, Revelation 19:6-7. II. The marriage of the Lamb, Revelation 19:8-9. The Lamb of God is united to his bride - the church - never more to be separated; and after all the persecutions, conflicts, and embarrassments which had existed, this long-desired union is consummated, and the glorious triumph of the church is described under the image of a joyous wedding ceremony. III. John is so overcome with this representation, transports of feeling he prostrates himself before the angel who shows him all this, ready to worship one who discloses such bright and glorious scenes, Revelation 19:10. He is gently rebuked for allowing himself to be so overcome that he would render divine homage to any creature, and is told that he who communicates this to him is but a fellow-servant, and that God only is to be worshipped.",

Revelation 20:6Blessed and holy is he that has first resurrection: on such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years. Revelation 20:7And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, Revelation 20:8And shall go out to deceive the nations which four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.",

Chapter Introduction We are now come to the dark part of the whole revelation. What is meant by the thousand years, and the first and second resurrection, and by Gog and Magog, Revelation 20:1-15, or the new heavens and new earth, and the Jerusalem coming down from heaven, discoursed on, Revelation 21:1-22:21, is very hard to say, and possibly much more cannot with any probability be conjectured as to them than has been already said. I shall only tell my reader that, leaving him to judge what is most probable, and leaving it to he Divine Providence to give us a certain and infallible exposition of what is last three chapters. The description of this angel can agree to none but Christ, or one that exercises a power by delegation from him: for, Revelation 1:18, it is he who has the power of hell and death; and it is he who alone is stronger than the devil, which must be supposed to him that binds him, or we must think the devil much tamer than he is. Revelation 20:2And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, There can be no question who is meant by the dragon here, and the old serpent, for the Holy Ghost interpretes it, the devil, the enemy of mankind.",

It is not to be wondered at, therefore, for the reason notes on Revelation 16:16, that much obscurity should hang over it, nor that it is difficult to explain it so as to remove all obscurity. The chapter, however, is distinct and general characteristics, and time will make all its particular statements free from ambiguity. In the previous chapter, an account is given of the final destruction of two of the most formidable enemies of the church, and consequently the removal of two of the hindrances to the universal spread of the gospel - the beast and the false prophet - the papal and the Muhammedan powers. But one obstacle remains to be removed - the power of Satan as concentrated and form of pagan power. These three powers it was said Revelation 16:13-14 would concentrate their forces as the time of the final triumph of Christianity drew on; and with these the last great battle was to be fought. Two of these have been subdued; the conqu over the other remains, and Satan is to be arrested and bound for a thousand years. He is then to be released for a time, and afterward finally destroyed, and at that period the end will come. The chapter comprises the following parts: I. The binding of Satan, Revelation 20:1-3. An angel comes down from heaven with the key of the bottomless pit, and a great hand, and seizes upon the dragon, and casts him into the pit, that for a thousand years he should deceive the nations no more.",

That happy state is depicted under the image of a beautiful city, of which Jerusalem was the emblem, and it was disclosed to John by a vision of that city - the New Jerusalem - descending from heaven. Jerusalem was regarded as the unique dwelling-place of God, and to the Hebrews it became thus the natural emblem or symbol of the heavenly world. The conception having occurred of describing the future condition of the righteous under the image of a beautiful city, all that follows is in \"keeping\" with that, and is merely a carrying out of the image. It is a city with beautiful walls and gates; a city that has no temple - for it is all a temple; a city that needs no light - for God is its light; a city into which nothing impure ever enters; a city filled with trees, and streams, and fountains, and fruits - the \"Paradise Regained. \" The description of that blessed state comprises the following parts: I. A vision of a new heaven and a new earth, as the final abode of the blessed, Revelation 21:1.

A new chapter should have commenced at Revelation 22:6; for the remainder properly comprises the conclusion of the whole book. Compare the introduction to the notes on the Gospels. Analysis Of Chapter 22:6-20 This portion of the Book of Revelation is properly the epilogue, or conclusion. The main purposes of the vision are accomplished; the enemies of the church are quelled; the church is triumphant; the affairs of the world are wound up; the redeemed are received to their blissful, eternal abode; the wicked are cut off; the earth is purified, and the affairs of the universe are fixed on their permanent foundation.
