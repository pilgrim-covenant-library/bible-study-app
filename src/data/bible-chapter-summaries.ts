    summary: 'In spring, when kings go to battle, David sends Joab and the army against Ammon while he stays in Jerusalem. One evening, walking on his roof, he sees a beautiful woman bathing. He inquires: Bathsheba, wife of Uriah the Hittite. He sends for her; he lies with her; she returns home and conceives. She sends word: I am pregnant. David recalls Uriah from the siege, hoping he\'ll go home to his wife and cover the adultery. Uriah refuses: the ark and Israel dwell in tents; Joab and my lord\'s servants camp in the open field. Shall I go home to eat, drink, and lie with my wife? David tries again, getting him drunk, but Uriah still won\'t go home. David sends a letter to Joab by Uriah\'s hand: put Uriah in the fiercest fighting and withdraw, so he will be struck down and die. Joab obeys. Uriah dies. After Bathsheba\'s mourning period, David takes her as wife. She bears a son. But the thing David had done was evil in the LORD\'s eyes.',

Nathan: you are the man! God gave you everything—why have you despised His word? You killed Uriah and took his wife. Now the sword will never depart from your house.

When the priests withdraw, the cloud fills the house so they cannot stand to minister—the glory of the LORD fills the temple. Solomon declares: the LORD said He would dwell in thick darkness. I have built You an exalted house. He blesses the assembly, recounting God\'s promise to David. His prayer: will God indeed dwell on earth? Heaven of heavens cannot contain You—how much less this house! Yet regard Your servant\'s prayer. May Your eyes be open toward this house night and day. Hear and forgive when Your people pray toward this place: when they sin, when defeated in battle, when there\'s drought, famine, plague, when they\'re carried captive. He prays for foreigners who come to pray. Final appeal: let all peoples know the LORD is God; there is no other. He blesses the people and offers massive sacrifices. The feast lasts fourteen days.',

    summary: 'The LORD appears to Solomon a second time as at Gibeon. He has heard Solomon\'s prayer. If Solomon walks before Him as David did, with integrity and uprightness, obeying His commands, God will establish his throne over Israel forever. But if you turn aside and serve other gods, I will cut off Israel from the land and cast out this house. This house will become a heap of ruins; everyone passing will hiss and ask: why has the LORD done this? Answer: because they forsook the LORD. After twenty years of building, Solomon gives Hiram twenty cities in Galilee—Hiram is displeased, calling them Cabul ("good for nothing"). Hiram had sent 120 talents of gold. Solomon uses forced labor (from remnant Canaanite peoples) for his projects. Israelites are soldiers and officials. Three times yearly Solomon offers sacrifices on the altar he built. He builds a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber; Hiram\'s sailors teach Solomon\'s men. They sail to Ophir, bringing back 420 talents of gold.',

Seeing his wisdom, the house he built, the food on his table, the seating of his officials, their clothing, his cupbearers, and his burnt offerings, she is breathless. She confesses: the report I heard in my country was true, but I didn\'t believe it until I came and saw. The half wasn\'t told me! Your wisdom and prosperity exceed the report. Blessed be the LORD your God who delighted in you, setting you on Israel\'s throne. Because of His eternal love for Israel, He made you king to execute justice and righteousness.

    summary: 'Josiah gathers all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. He reads all the Book of the Covenant found in the temple to the people. He makes a covenant to follow the LORD and keep His commands with all his heart. All the people join the covenant. Josiah removes from the temple all vessels made for Baal, Asherah, and the host of heaven—he burns them. He deposes the idolatrous priests. He brings out the Asherah from the temple and burns it at the Kidron. He breaks down the quarters of male cult prostitutes. He defiles Topheth so no one can burn sons or daughters to Molech. He removes horses dedicated to the sun and burns the chariots. He destroys altars kings made on rooftops and those Manasseh made in the temple courts. He defiles the high places Solomon built for foreign gods. He pulls down the altar at Bethel that Jeroboam made, burning bones on it to defile it—fulfilling the prophecy from 1 Kings 13. He executes all the high place priests of the northern cities. He keeps Passover—none like it since the judges\' days. He removes mediums, necromancers, teraphim, idols. Before him there was no king who turned to the LORD with all his heart, soul, and might; none arose after him like him. Yet the LORD didn\'t turn from His fierce anger against Judah because of all Manasseh\'s provocation. Pharaoh Neco of Egypt marches north to help Assyria against Babylon. Josiah intercepts him at Megiddo. Neco kills Josiah. The people make Jehoahaz his son king.',

He turns his complaint to God directly: "I will not restrain my mouth." He asks why God pays such close attention to humans, watching constantly, not looking away even for a moment. If he has sinned, what does that do to God? Why not pardon his transgression? He will soon die and be gone.',
    keyThemes: ['Life\'s brevity', 'Direct complaint to God', 'Divine surveillance', 'Desire for pardon'],
    christConnection: 'Job\'s bold complaint to God shows that honest prayer is acceptable. Christ taught us to bring all concerns to the Father. Job\'s question about human significance anticipates the answer in Christ: God cares because we matter to Him.'

If Job is pure, God will restore him. Bildad appeals to the wisdom of past generations: the wicked perish like plants without water, while the blameless are not rejected. He assumes Job must be guilty since God would not afflict the innocent.',

Job describes God\'s awesome power in creation—moving mountains, commanding the sun, walking on waves. Yet this power seems overwhelming, not comforting.

    title: 'Job\'s Repentance and Restoration',
    summary: 'Job responds in humble repentance: he had spoken of things too wonderful, things he did not understand. "I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you; therefore I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes." God rebukes the three friends for not speaking rightly as Job did; they must offer sacrifice and have Job pray for them. Then God restores Job\'s fortunes double—twice the livestock, ten more children, 140 more years of life.',

    christConnection: 'Job\'s encounter with God brought transformation—not answers to every question, but a relationship. Christ offers the same: not always explanations, but Himself. The restoration points to resurrection hope when all losses are more than restored.'

Leave your simple ways and live; walk in the way of insight." The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. By me your days will be multiplied. Folly is loud and seductive; she sits at the door of her house calling, "Stolen water is sweet." But the dead are there; her guests are in the depths of Sheol.',

    summary: 'Dead flies make the perfumer\'s ointment give off a stench; so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor. A wise man\'s heart inclines to the right; a fool\'s to the left. Even when the fool walks, his sense is lacking. If the serpent bites before it is charmed, there is no advantage to the charmer. Words from a wise man\'s mouth win favor, but a fool\'s lips consume him. Whoever digs a pit may fall into it. If the iron is blunt and one does not sharpen the edge, he must use more strength, but wisdom helps one to succeed. Curse not the king, even in your thought.',

If the clouds are full, they empty rain on the earth. He who observes the wind will not sow; he who regards the clouds will not reap. As you do not know the way the spirit comes to the bones in the womb, so you do not know the work of God who makes everything. In the morning sow your seed; in the evening withhold not your hand.

Man goes to his eternal home; mourners go about the streets. The silver cord is snapped; the golden bowl is broken. The dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to God who gave it. Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher; all is vanity. The end of the matter: Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. God will bring every deed into judgment.',

The fortress will disappear from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus. The remnant of Syria will be like the glory of the children of Israel, declares the LORD of hosts. In that day the glory of Jacob will be brought low. It shall be as when the reaper gathers grain, as when one gleans in the Valley of Rephaim. Gleanings will be left, like two or three berries in the top of the olive tree. In that day man will look to his Maker, and his eyes will look to the Holy One of Israel. He will not look to the altars, the work of his hands. Because you have forgotten the God of your salvation, you plant pleasant plants and set out foreign slips, but the harvest will flee away in a day of grief.',

For before the harvest, when the blossom is over and the flower becomes a ripening grape, He cuts off the shoots with pruning hooks.

In all their affliction He was afflicted, and the angel of His presence saved them. In His love and pity He redeemed them. But they rebelled and grieved His Holy Spirit.',

When You did awesome things that we did not look for, You came down; the mountains quaked at Your presence. From of old no one has heard or perceived by the ear, no eye has seen a God besides You, who acts for those who wait for Him. You meet him who joyfully works righteousness, those who remember You in Your ways. Behold, You were angry, and we sinned; in our sins we have been a long time, and shall we be saved? We have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment. We all fade like a leaf, and our iniquities carry us away like the wind.

It came also in the days of Jehoiakim and until the captivity of Jerusalem. The word of the LORD came to me: Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations. I said: Ah, Lord GOD! I do not know how to speak, for I am only a youth. But the LORD said: Do not say "I am only a youth," for you shall go wherever I send you. Do not be afraid, for I am with you to deliver you. Then the LORD touched my mouth: Behold, I have put My words in your mouth. See, I have set you this day over nations and kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant. I see a branch of an almond tree and a boiling pot, tilted away from the north. Out of the north disaster shall be let loose.

Israel was holy to the LORD, the firstfruits of His harvest. What wrong did your fathers find in Me that they went far from Me, and went after worthlessness and became worthless? They did not say: Where is the LORD? The priests did not know Me; the rulers transgressed against Me; the prophets prophesied by Baal. Has a nation changed its gods, even though they are no gods? But My people have changed their glory for that which does not profit. My people have committed two evils: they have forsaken Me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed out cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns that can hold no water. Is Israel a slave?

I gave faithless Israel her certificate of divorce, yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear. Return, faithless Israel; I will not look on you in anger, for I am merciful.

    summary: 'In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. The Lord gave Jehoiakim into his hand, with some of the vessels of the house of God. He brought them to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god. The king commanded Ashpenaz, his chief eunuch, to bring some of the people of Israel, of the royal family and of the nobility—youths without blemish, of good appearance, skillful in wisdom, endowed with knowledge, competent to stand in the king\'s palace—to teach them the literature and language of the Chaldeans. Among these were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah of the tribe of Judah. The chief of the eunuchs gave them names: Daniel he called Belteshazzar; Hananiah, Shadrach; Mishael, Meshach; and Azariah, Abednego. But Daniel resolved that he would not defile himself with the king\'s food or with the wine that he drank. God gave Daniel favor and compassion. He tested them for ten days. At the end, they were better in appearance and fatter in flesh than all the youths who ate the king\'s food. God gave these four youths learning and skill; to Daniel He gave understanding in all visions and dreams.',

The king commanded the magicians, enchanters, sorcerers, and Chaldeans to tell him his dreams. But they said: Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation. The king answered: If you do not make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you shall be torn limb from limb. The Chaldeans said: There is not a man on earth who can meet the king\'s demand. No god can reveal it. Then Daniel went to Arioch and said: Do not destroy the wise men. Bring me before the king, and I will show the interpretation. That night the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Daniel blessed the God of heaven: He reveals deep and hidden things. Daniel said to the king: There is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. You saw a great image—head of gold, chest of silver, middle of bronze, legs of iron, feet of iron and clay. A stone cut out by no human hand struck the image and became a great mountain filling the earth. You are the head of gold. After you, another kingdom, then another.

The herald proclaimed aloud: When you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and every kind of music, you are to fall down and worship the golden image. Whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into a burning fiery furnace. Certain Chaldeans came forward and maliciously accused the Jews: There are certain Jews—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—they pay no attention to you, O king. They do not serve your gods or worship the golden image. Nebuchadnezzar in furious rage commanded that they be brought. He said: Is it true? If you do not worship, you shall be cast into the furnace. And who is the god who will deliver you? They answered: Our God whom we serve is able to deliver us. But if not, be it known that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image. He ordered the furnace heated seven times more than usual. They bound them and cast them in. The fire killed the soldiers.

His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom. I was at ease in my house and prospering in my palace. I saw a dream that made me afraid. I commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be brought before me. Then Daniel came in, and I told the dream before him: I saw a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great. It grew and became strong, reaching to heaven. Behold, a watcher, a holy one, came down from heaven. He cried aloud: Chop down the tree, but leave the stump. Let him be wet with dew and his portion be with the beasts. Let seven periods of time pass over him, till he knows that the Most High rules the kingdom of men. Daniel was dismayed. He said: The tree is you, O king. You shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, till you know that the Most High rules. Twelve months later, as the king was walking on the roof: Is not this great Babylon, which I have built by my mighty power and for the glory of my majesty?

They drank wine and praised the gods of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone. Immediately the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall of the king\'s palace. Then the king\'s color changed, and his thoughts alarmed him; his limbs gave way, and his knees knocked together. They brought Daniel before the king. Daniel said: O king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father kingship, but when his heart was lifted up in pride, he was brought low. And you his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this. You have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven.

King Darius signed the document. When Daniel knew the document had been signed, he went to his house where he had windows open toward Jerusalem.

I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three horns were plucked up. And behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things. As I looked, thrones were placed, and the Ancient of Days took His seat; His clothing was white as snow, and the hair of His head like pure wool; His throne was fiery flames.

Then the goat became exceedingly great, but when he was strong, the great horn was broken, and instead of it there came up four conspicuous horns. Out of one of them came a little horn, which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the glorious land. It took away the regular burnt offering, and the place of his sanctuary was overthrown. Gabriel said: Understand, O son of man, that the vision is for the time of the end.

Then I turned my face to the Lord God, seeking Him by prayer and pleas for mercy with fasting and sackcloth and ashes. I prayed to the LORD my God and made confession: O Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love Him and keep His commandments, we have sinned and done wrong. To You, O Lord, belongs righteousness, but to us open shame. O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive. While I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel came to me in swift flight.

Seventy weeks are decreed about your people and your holy city, to finish the transgression, to put an end to sin, and to atone for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal both vision and prophet, and to anoint a most holy place.

Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth, and my judgment goes forth as the light. For I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice, the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings. But like Adam they transgressed the covenant; there they dealt faithlessly with me.',

Let us rise against her for battle! Behold, I will make you small among the nations; you shall be utterly despised. The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who live in the clefts of the rock, in your lofty dwelling, who say in your heart, Who will bring me down to the ground? Though you soar aloft like the eagle, though your nest is set among the stars, from there I will bring you down, declares the LORD. For the violence done to your brother Jacob, shame shall cover you, and you shall be cut off forever. On the day that you stood aloof, on the day that strangers carried off his wealth and foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem, you were like one of them. But do not gloat over the day of your brother in the day of his misfortune; do not rejoice over the people of Judah in the day of their ruin. For the day of the LORD is near upon all the nations. As you have done, it shall be done to you. But in Mount Zion there shall be those who escape, and it shall be holy, and the house of Jacob shall possess their own possessions. The house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau stubble.',

But Jonah rose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD. He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. So he paid the fare and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish, away from the presence of the LORD. But the LORD hurled a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship threatened to break up. Then the mariners were afraid, and each cried out to his god. And they hurled the cargo that was in the ship into the sea to lighten it for them. But Jonah had gone down into the inner part of the ship and had lain down and was fast asleep. So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah. He said to them, Pick me up and hurl me into the sea; then the sea will quiet down for you, for I know it is because of me that this great tempest has come upon you. So they picked up Jonah and hurled him into the sea, and the sea ceased from its raging. Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly.',

Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the belly of the fish, saying, I called out to the LORD, out of my distress, and he answered me; out of the belly of Sheol I cried, and you heard my voice. For you cast me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and the flood surrounded me; all your waves and your billows passed over me. Then I said, I am driven away from your sight; yet I shall again look upon your holy temple. The waters closed in over me to take my life; the deep surrounded me; weeds were wrapped about my head at the roots of the mountains. I went down to the land whose bars closed upon me forever; yet you brought up my life from the pit, O LORD my God. When my life was fainting away, I remembered the LORD, and my prayer came to you, into your holy temple. Those who pay regard to vain idols forsake their hope of steadfast love.

Jonah began to go into the city, going a day\'s journey. And he called out, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown! And the people of Nineveh believed God. They called for a fast and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them to the least of them. The word reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, removed his robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. And he issued a proclamation: Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything. Let them not feed or drink water, but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and let them call out mightily to God.

Therefore now, O LORD, please take my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live. And the LORD said, Do you do well to be angry? Jonah went out of the city and sat to the east of the city and made a booth for himself there. And the LORD God appointed a plant and made it come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to save him from his discomfort. So Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the plant. But when dawn came up the next day, God appointed a worm that attacked the plant, so that it withered. When the sun rose, God appointed a scorching east wind.

And the LORD said, You pity the plant, for which you did not labor, nor did you make it grow.

Then the word of the LORD came by the hand of Haggai the prophet, Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins? Now, therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts: Consider your ways. You have sown much, and harvested little. You eat, but you never have enough; you drink, but you never have your fill. You have looked for much, and behold, it came to little. And when you brought it home, I blew it away. Why? declares the LORD of hosts. Because of my house that lies in ruins, while each of you busies himself with his own house. Go up to the hills and bring wood and build the house, that I may take pleasure in it and that I may be glorified, says the LORD.

    summary: 'The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. Abraham was the father of Isaac, and Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers. The genealogy traces through the kings of Judah to Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ. Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins. All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel.',

For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him. When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. And assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. They told him, In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet. And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way. Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him. Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became furious, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem. Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah: A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and loud lamentation. But when Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, Rise, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel. And he rose and took the child and came and lived in a city called Nazareth, so that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled: He shall be called a Nazarene.',

Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him, and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruit in keeping with repentance. Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. John would have prevented him, saying, I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me? But Jesus answered him, Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness. And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him; and behold, a voice from heaven said, This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.',

But the centurion replied, Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but only say the word, and my servant will be healed. When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, Truly, I tell you, with no one in Israel have I found such faith. That evening they brought to him many who were oppressed by demons, and he cast out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick. This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: He took our illnesses and bore our diseases. And when Jesus got into the boat, his disciples followed him.

If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them.

    summary: 'And Pharisees came up and in order to test him asked, Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife? He answered them, What did Moses command you? They said, Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce and to send her away. And Jesus said, Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment. But from the beginning of creation, God made them male and female. Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate. And they were bringing children to him that he might touch them. Let the children come to me; do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him. Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life? Go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. Disheartened by the saying, he went away sorrowful. It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.',

Untie it and bring it. And they brought the colt to Jesus. And those who went before and those who followed were shouting, Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest! And he entered Jerusalem and went into the temple. And when he had looked around at everything, as it was already late, he went out to Bethany. On the following day, when they came from Bethany, he was hungry. And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see if he could find anything on it. Finding nothing but leaves, he said to it, May no one ever eat fruit from you again.

In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, of the division of Abijah. And he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. They were both righteous before God. And they had no child. And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God. And Zechariah said, How shall I know this? For I am an old man. In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph. The virgin\'s name was Mary. Greetings, O favored one, the Lord is with you! You will conceive and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High.

And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn. And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field. And an angel of the Lord appeared to them. Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased! And when the time came for their purification, they brought him up to Jerusalem. Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon. Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace.

I baptize you with water, but he who is mightier than I is coming, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heavens were opened, and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form, like a dove; and a voice came from heaven, You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.

    summary: 'One Sabbath, when he went to dine at the house of a ruler of the Pharisees, they were watching him carefully. And behold, there was a man before him who had dropsy. And Jesus spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not? But they remained silent. Then he took him and healed him and sent him away. Now he told a parable to those who were invited, when he noticed how they chose the places of honor. When you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted. When you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind. A man once gave a great banquet and invited many. But they all alike began to make excuses. Go out quickly to the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor and crippled and blind and lame. Go out to the highways and hedges and compel people to come in, that my house may be filled. If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple. Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.',

And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance. Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and search carefully until she finds it? And he said, There was a man who had two sons. And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the share of property that is coming to me. But when he came to himself, he said, I will arise and go to my father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him.

For the sons of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than the sons of light. One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much. No servant can serve two masters. You cannot serve God and money. The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things, and they ridiculed him.

They answered him, We are offspring of Abraham. Jesus said to them, If you were Abraham\'s children, you would be doing the works Abraham did. You are of your father the devil.

Jesus answered, It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be displayed in him. We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. Having said these things, he spit on the ground and made mud with the saliva. Then he anointed the man\'s eyes with the mud and said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam. So he went and washed and came back seeing. The neighbors said, Is this not the man who used to sit and beg? They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind. Now it was a Sabbath day. So the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. They said, This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath. But others said, How can a man who is a sinner do such signs? And Jesus said, For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind. Some of the Pharisees heard these things, and said to him, Are we also blind? Jesus said to them, If you were blind, you would have no guilt; but now that you say, We see, your guilt remains.',

Then after this he said to the disciples, Let us go to Judea again. Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to awaken him. So when Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days. Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. Jesus said to her, Your brother will rise again. Martha said to him, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day. Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?

The next day the large crowd heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, crying out, Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel! And Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, just as it is written. Now among those who went up to worship at the feast were some Greeks. Sir, we wish to see Jesus. And Jesus answered them, The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. Now is the judgment of this world; now will the ruler of this world be cast out.

As he nears Damascus, a light from heaven flashes around him. He falls to the ground and hears a voice: Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? He asks, Who are you, Lord? The voice answers, I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. Rise and enter the city. Saul is blinded and neither eats nor drinks for three days. The Lord tells Ananias to go to Saul, for he is a chosen instrument to carry Christ\'s name before Gentiles, kings, and Israel. Ananias lays hands on him; something like scales falls from his eyes. Saul is baptized and immediately proclaims Jesus in the synagogues, saying He is the Son of God. The Jews plot to kill him, but the disciples lower him in a basket through the wall. Barnabas brings him to the apostles in Jerusalem. The church has peace and multiplies. Peter heals Aeneas at Lydda and raises Tabitha at Joppa.',

Meanwhile, Peter has a vision: a sheet descends from heaven with all kinds of animals. A voice says, Rise, Peter; kill and eat. Peter refuses, saying he has never eaten anything unclean. The voice says, What God has made clean, do not call common. This happens three times. While Peter ponders, the men from Cornelius arrive. The Spirit tells Peter to go with them. Peter goes and finds many gathered. He says, God has shown me I should not call any person common or unclean. Cornelius tells of the angel\'s visit. Peter opens his mouth and says, Truly I understand that God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears Him and does what is right is acceptable to Him. He preaches Jesus—His anointing, miracles, crucifixion, and resurrection. While Peter speaks, the Holy Spirit falls on all who hear.

Therefore let it be known that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will listen. Paul stays two whole years at his own expense, welcoming all who come to him, proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance.',

    chapter: 1,
    title: 'Divisions and the Cross',
    summary: 'Paul, called by the will of God to be an apostle, writes to the church of God at Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be saints. He gives thanks for the grace given them in Christ—they were enriched in all speech and knowledge and are not lacking in any gift as they wait for the revealing of the Lord Jesus Christ. But he appeals to them that there be no divisions among them. It has been reported that there are quarrels: some say, I follow Paul; others, I follow Apollos; or, I follow Cephas; or, I follow Christ. Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Paul thanks God he baptized none of them except Crispus and Gaius, lest anyone say they were baptized into Paul\'s name. Christ did not send him to baptize but to preach the gospel—not with words of eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power. For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. The foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men. Not many were wise, powerful, or of noble birth. God chose what is foolish to shame the wise, what is weak to shame the strong, so that no human being might boast in the presence of God. Christ Jesus became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption.',

    title: 'The Spirit Reveals God\'s Wisdom',
    summary: 'Paul came to Corinth not with lofty speech or wisdom, proclaiming the testimony of God. He decided to know nothing among them except Jesus Christ and Him crucified. He was with them in weakness and fear and much trembling, and his speech and message were not in plausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, so that their faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God. Yet among the mature he imparts wisdom—not of this age or of its rulers, who are doomed to pass away. He speaks the wisdom of God, a mystery hidden, which God decreed before the ages for our glory. None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. As it is written, What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man imagined, what God has prepared for those who love Him—these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit. The Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God. No one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. We have received the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God. The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God. But we have the mind of Christ.',

    title: 'God\'s Fellow Workers',
    summary: 'Paul could not address the Corinthians as spiritual people, but as infants in Christ. He fed them with milk, not solid food, for they were not ready. They are still not ready, for there is jealousy and strife among them. When one says, I follow Paul, and another, I follow Apollos, are they not being merely human? What is Apollos? What is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, as the Lord assigned to each. Paul planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth. So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth. He who plants and he who waters are one, and each will receive his wages according to his labor. For we are God\'s fellow workers. You are God\'s field, God\'s building. According to the grace given to Paul, like a skilled master builder he laid a foundation, and someone else is building upon it. Let each one take care how he builds. For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. If anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw—each one\'s work will become manifest, for the Day will disclose it. It will be revealed by fire. Do you not know that you are God\'s temple and that God\'s Spirit dwells in you? If anyone destroys God\'s temple, God will destroy him. Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks he is wise, let him become a fool that he may become wise.',

    title: 'Servants of Christ and Stewards',
    summary: 'This is how one should regard Paul and his fellow workers: as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God. It is required of stewards that they be found faithful. With Paul it is a very small thing that he should be judged by the Corinthians or by any human court. He does not even judge himself. He is not aware of anything against himself, but he is not thereby acquitted. It is the Lord who judges him. Therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness. Then each one will receive his commendation from God. Paul has applied all this to himself and Apollos for their benefit, that they may learn not to go beyond what is written, that none may be puffed up in favor of one against another. What do you have that you did not receive? If you received it, why do you boast as if you did not receive it? Already they are filled, already rich, already reigning! Paul wishes they did reign, so he might reign with them. God has exhibited the apostles as last of all, like men sentenced to death, a spectacle to the world. They are fools for Christ\'s sake; the Corinthians are wise in Christ. The apostles hunger, thirst, are poorly dressed, buffeted, homeless. When reviled, they bless; when persecuted, they endure; when slandered, they entreat. Paul writes not to shame them but to admonish them as beloved children. He urges them to be imitators of him.',

    title: 'Church Discipline',
    summary: 'It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among them, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans—a man has his father\'s wife. And they are arrogant! Ought they not rather to mourn? Let him who has done this be removed from among them. Paul, though absent in body, is present in spirit, and he has already pronounced judgment on the one who did such a thing. When they are assembled in the name of the Lord Jesus, with the power of our Lord Jesus, they are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord. Their boasting is not good. Do they not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? Cleanse out the old leaven that they may be a new lump, as they really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. Therefore let us celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Paul wrote in a previous letter not to associate with sexually immoral people—not meaning the immoral of this world, but rather any so-called brother who is guilty of immorality. With such a one do not even eat. God judges those outside. Purge the evil person from among you.',

    title: 'Lawsuits and the Body',
    summary: 'When one of them has a grievance against another, does he dare go to law before the unrighteous instead of the saints? Do they not know that the saints will judge the world? If the world is to be judged by them, are they incompetent to try trivial cases? Do they not know that they will judge angels? How much more, matters of this life! If they have such cases, why do they lay them before those who have no standing in the church? Paul says this to their shame. Can it be that there is no one wise enough to settle a dispute? To have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat. Why not rather suffer wrong? Why not rather be defrauded? But they wrong and defraud—even their own brothers. Do they not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of them. But they were washed, they were sanctified, they were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God. All things are lawful, but not all things are helpful. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. God raised the Lord and will also raise us. Your bodies are members of Christ. Shall one take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit. You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.',

    chapter: 7,
    title: 'Marriage and Singleness',
    summary: 'Now concerning the matters about which they wrote: It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman. But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband. The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband. Do not deprive one another, except perhaps by agreement for a limited time, that you may devote yourselves to prayer; then come together again. Paul says this as a concession, not a command. He wishes that all were as he is, but each has his own gift from God. To the unmarried and widows Paul says: it is good for them to remain single as he is. But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. To the married he gives charge—not he, but the Lord—that the wife should not separate from her husband, and the husband should not divorce his wife. If an unbelieving partner separates, let it be so; God has called them to peace. Each should remain in the condition in which they were called. Are they called while circumcised, uncircumcised, a bondservant? Remain with God in whatever condition you were called. Concerning the betrothed: Paul has no command from the Lord but gives his judgment. In view of the present distress it is good to remain as you are. If you marry, you have not sinned. Yet those who marry will have worldly troubles. The appointed time has grown very short. He who marries does well, and he who refrains from marriage will do even better.',

    chapter: 8,
    title: 'Food Offered to Idols',
    summary: 'Now concerning food offered to idols: Paul knows that they all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. If anyone imagines that he knows something, he does not yet know as he ought to know. But if anyone loves God, he is known by God. Therefore, as to the eating of food offered to idols, we know that an idol has no real existence, and that there is no God but one. For although there may be so-called gods in heaven or on earth—as indeed there are many gods and many lords—yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist. However, not all possess this knowledge. Some, through former association with idols, eat food as really offered to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. Food will not commend us to God. We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do. But take care that this right does not become a stumbling block to the weak. For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol\'s temple, will not his conscience be encouraged to eat food offered to idols? And so by your knowledge this weak person is destroyed, the brother for whom Christ died. Thus, sinning against your brothers and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ. Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, Paul will never eat meat, lest he make his brother stumble.',

    title: 'Paul\'s Rights as an Apostle',
    summary: 'Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are not the Corinthians Paul\'s workmanship in the Lord? They are the seal of his apostleship. This is his defense to those who would examine him. Do we not have the right to eat and drink? Do we not have the right to take along a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas? Do only Barnabas and Paul lack the right to refrain from working for a living? The Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel. But Paul has made no use of any of these rights. He would rather die than have anyone deprive him of this ground for boasting. For if he preaches the gospel, that gives him no ground for boasting. Necessity is laid upon him. Woe to him if he does not preach the gospel! He has become all things to all people, that by all means he might save some. To the Jews he became as a Jew; to those outside the law as one outside the law; to the weak he became weak. He does it all for the sake of the gospel, that he may share with them in its blessings. Do they not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it. Every athlete exercises self-control. They do it for a perishable wreath, but we for an imperishable. Paul disciplines his body and keeps it under control, lest after preaching to others he himself should be disqualified.',

    summary: 'Paul does not want them to be unaware that all the fathers were under the cloud, all passed through the sea, all were baptized into Moses, all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual Rock that followed them, and the Rock was Christ. Nevertheless, with most of them God was not pleased, and they were overthrown in the wilderness. Now these things took place as examples for us, that we might not desire evil as they did. Do not be idolaters as some of them were. We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did—and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day. We must not put Christ to the test. We must not grumble. These things were written down for our instruction, on whom the end of the ages has come. Therefore let anyone who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall. No temptation has overtaken them that is not common to man. God is faithful, and He will not let them be tempted beyond their ability, but with the temptation He will also provide the way of escape. Therefore flee from idolatry. The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body. Whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.',

    title: 'Head Coverings and the Lord\'s Supper',
    summary: 'Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ. Paul commends them because they maintain the traditions as he delivered them. But he wants them to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a wife is her husband, and the head of Christ is God. Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head, but every wife who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head. Man is the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man. For man was not made from woman, but woman from man. In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man nor man of woman. Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a wife to pray to God with her head uncovered? Nature itself teaches them. But in giving these instructions, Paul does not commend them, because when they come together it is not for the better but for the worse. There are divisions among them. When they come together, it is not the Lord\'s supper they eat. Each one goes ahead with his own meal; one goes hungry, another gets drunk. Do they not have houses to eat and drink in? Do they despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? Whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a person examine himself. For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself.',

No one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says Jesus is accursed, and no one can say Jesus is Lord except in the Holy Spirit. There are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; varieties of service, but the same Lord; varieties of activities, but it is the same God who empowers them all in everyone. To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. To one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, to another the utterance of knowledge, to another faith, to another gifts of healing, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the ability to distinguish between spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. All these are empowered by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to each one individually as He wills. For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. In one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit. The body does not consist of one member but of many. The eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you. God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it, that there may be no division in the body. You are the body of Christ and individually members of it.',

If he has prophetic powers and understands all mysteries and all knowledge, and if he has all faith so as to remove mountains, but has not love, he is nothing. If he gives away all he has and delivers up his body to be burned, but has not love, he gains nothing. Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. When Paul was a child, he spoke like a child, thought like a child, reasoned like a child. When he became a man, he gave up childish ways. For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known. So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.',

For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit. On the other hand, the one who prophesies speaks to people for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation. The one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but the one who prophesies builds up the church. Paul would like them all to speak in tongues, but even more to prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be built up. If Paul comes speaking in tongues, how will he benefit them unless he brings revelation, knowledge, prophecy, or teaching? Even lifeless instruments must give distinct notes, or no one will know what is played. So with them: if they utter speech that is not intelligible, how will anyone know what is said? There are many languages in the world, and none is without meaning. If Paul does not know the meaning, he will be a foreigner to the speaker. Since they are eager for spiritual gifts, strive to excel in building up the church. If there is no interpreter, let the tongue-speaker keep silent in church. Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said. God is not a God of confusion but of peace. All things should be done decently and in order.',

Last of all He appeared also to Paul. If Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of them say there is no resurrection of the dead? If there is no resurrection, then Christ has not been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is in vain and so is their faith. We are even found to be misrepresenting God. If the dead are not raised, Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die. But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive. But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, then at His coming those who belong to Christ. Then comes the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God the Father. The last enemy to be destroyed is death. What is sown is perishable; what is raised is imperishable. It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. The first man Adam became a living being; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, at the last trumpet. Death is swallowed up in victory. Thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.',

On the first day of every week, each of them is to put something aside and store it up, as he may prosper, so that there will be no collecting when Paul comes. And when he arrives, he will send those whom they accredit to carry their gift to Jerusalem. Paul will visit them after passing through Macedonia. Perhaps he will stay with them or even spend the winter, so that they may help him on his journey. He does not want to see them now just in passing; he hopes to spend some time with them, if the Lord permits. But he will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost, for a wide door for effective work has opened to him, and there are many adversaries. When Timothy comes, see that he has nothing to fear, for he is doing the work of the Lord. As for Apollos, Paul strongly urged him to visit them, but it was not at all his will to come now; he will come when he has opportunity. Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong. Let all that you do be done in love. They know the household of Stephanas, the first converts in Achaia, who devoted themselves to the service of the saints. Be subject to such as these. Greet one another with a holy kiss. Paul writes this greeting with his own hand. If anyone has no love for the Lord, let him be accursed. Our Lord, come! The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.

    summary: 'Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God at Corinth, with all the saints in Achaia: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. For as we share abundantly in Christ\'s sufferings, so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too. If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation. Paul was so utterly burdened beyond his strength that he despaired of life itself. But that was to make him rely not on himself but on God who raises the dead. God delivered him from such a deadly peril, and He will deliver him again. Paul\'s boast is the testimony of his conscience that he has acted with holiness and godly sincerity. He wanted to visit them but changed his plans—not out of fickleness, but to spare them. For all the promises of God find their Yes in Christ. That is why it is through Him that we utter our Amen to God for His glory. God establishes us with you in Christ, has anointed us, sealed us, and given us His Spirit as a guarantee.',

    title: 'Forgiveness and the Fragrance of Christ',
    summary: 'Paul made up his mind not to make another painful visit to them. For if he caused them pain, who was there to make him glad but the one he had pained? He wrote as he did so that when he came he might not suffer pain from those who should have made him rejoice. He wrote out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause them pain but to let them know the abundant love he had for them. If anyone has caused pain, he has caused it not to Paul but in some measure to all of them. For such a one, the punishment by the majority is enough, so they should turn to forgive and comfort him, or he may be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. Paul urges them to reaffirm their love for him. Anyone they forgive, Paul also forgives. What he has forgiven has been for their sake in the presence of Christ, so that they would not be outwitted by Satan. When Paul came to Troas to preach the gospel, a door was opened for him in the Lord. But his spirit was not at rest because he did not find Titus. Thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of Him everywhere. We are the aroma of Christ to God among those being saved and among those perishing—to one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life.',

    title: 'Ministers of the New Covenant',
    summary: 'Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need letters of recommendation to or from them? They themselves are Paul\'s letter of recommendation, written on his heart, known and read by all. They are a letter from Christ delivered by Paul, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts. Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God. Not that we are sufficient in ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God, who has made us sufficient to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. Now if the ministry of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such glory that the Israelites could not gaze at Moses\' face because of its glory, will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory? If there was glory in the ministry of condemnation, the ministry of righteousness must far exceed it in glory. Indeed, what once had glory has come to have no glory at all, because of the glory that surpasses it. For if what was being brought to an end came with glory, much more will what is permanent have glory. Since we have such a hope, we are very bold. When one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed. Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another.',

We refuse to practice cunning or to tamper with God\'s word, but by the open statement of the truth we commend ourselves to everyone\'s conscience in the sight of God. And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. For what we proclaim is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, with ourselves as your servants for Jesus\' sake. For God, who said, Let light shine out of darkness, has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure in jars of clay, to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us. We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed; always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies. So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day.

    title: 'The Ministry of Reconciliation',
    summary: 'For we know that if the tent that is our earthly home is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For in this tent we groan, longing to put on our heavenly dwelling. While we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord. We walk by faith, not by sight. We would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord. So whether at home or away, we make it our aim to please Him. For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil. Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade others. The love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this: that one has died for all, therefore all have died; and He died for all, that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for Him who for their sake died and was raised. From now on, we regard no one according to the flesh. If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to Himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation. In Christ God was reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their trespasses against them. For our sake He made Him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.',

Behold, now is the favorable time; behold, now is the day of salvation. We put no obstacle in anyone\'s way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry. But as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: by great endurance, in afflictions, hardships, calamities, beatings, imprisonments, riots, labors, sleepless nights, hunger; by purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, the Holy Spirit, genuine love; by truthful speech, and the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left; through honor and dishonor, through slander and praise. We are treated as impostors, and yet are true; as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and yet not killed; as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet possessing everything. We have spoken freely to them; our heart is wide open. They are not restricted by us, but they are restricted in their own affections. In return, widen their hearts also. Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness? What accord has Christ with Belial?

    summary: 'Since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit, bringing holiness to completion in the fear of God. Make room in your hearts for us. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have taken advantage of no one. Paul does not say this to condemn them, for he said before that they are in his heart, to die together and to live together. He is acting with great boldness toward them; he has great pride in them; he is filled with comfort. In all his affliction, he is overflowing with joy. Even when he came into Macedonia, his body had no rest, but he was afflicted at every turn—fighting without and fear within. But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted him by the coming of Titus, and not only by his coming but also by the comfort with which he was comforted by them. Titus told Paul of their longing, their mourning, their zeal for him, so that he rejoiced still more. Even if he made them grieve with his letter, he does not regret it. He sees that the letter grieved them, but only for a while. Now he rejoices, not because they were grieved, but because their grief led to repentance. Godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death. See what earnestness their godly grief has produced in them, what eagerness to clear themselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what punishment! At every point they have proved themselves innocent in the matter.',

    title: 'The Grace of Giving',
    summary: 'Paul wants them to know about the grace of God given among the churches of Macedonia. In a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity. They gave according to their means, and beyond their means, of their own accord, begging earnestly for the favor of taking part in the relief of the saints. They gave themselves first to the Lord and then by the will of God to Paul. So he urged Titus to complete among them this act of grace. As they excel in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all earnestness, and in their love for Paul—see that they excel in this act of grace also. Paul says this not as a command, but to prove by the earnestness of others that their love also is genuine. For they know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for their sake He became poor, so that by His poverty they might become rich. Paul gives his judgment: it is best for them to complete what a year ago they began not only to do but to desire. Now finish doing it as well. If the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what he does not have. Paul is not saying that others should be eased and they burdened, but that as a matter of fairness their abundance may supply the need of others, and their abundance may supply their need, so that there may be fairness.',

    title: 'Cheerful Giving',
    summary: 'Now it is superfluous for Paul to write to them about the ministry for the saints, for he knows their readiness and boasts about it to the Macedonians, saying that Achaia has been ready since last year. Their zeal has stirred up most of them. But he is sending the brothers so that their boasting about them may not prove empty, so that they may be ready as he said they would be. Otherwise, if some Macedonians come with Paul and find them unprepared, they would be humiliated—to say nothing of the Corinthians—for being so confident. So he thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead and arrange in advance for the gift they promised, so that it may be ready as a willing gift, not as an exaction. The point is this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to make all grace abound to them, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, they may abound in every good work. He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply their seed for sowing and increase the harvest of their righteousness. They will be enriched in every way to be generous in every way, which through Paul will produce thanksgiving to God. Thanks be to God for His inexpressible gift!',

He begs them that when he is present he may not have to show boldness with such confidence as he counts on showing against some who suspect them of walking according to the flesh. For though we walk in the flesh, we are not waging war according to the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but have divine power to destroy strongholds. We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ. They are ready to punish every disobedience when their obedience is complete. Look at what is before them. If anyone is confident that he is Christ\'s, let him remind himself that just as he is Christ\'s, so also is Paul. Even if Paul boasts a little too much of the authority which the Lord gave for building them up and not for destroying them, he will not be ashamed. He does not want to appear to be frightening them with his letters. Some say his letters are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak and his speech of no account. Let such a person understand that what Paul says by letter when absent, he will do when present. Paul will not boast beyond limits, but will boast only with regard to the area of influence God assigned to him. Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.',

He is jealous for them with a godly jealousy, for he betrothed them to one husband, to present them as a pure virgin to Christ. But he fears that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, their thoughts will be led astray from sincere devotion to Christ. For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus or a different gospel, they put up with it readily enough. Paul considers himself not in the least inferior to these super-apostles. Even if he is unskilled in speaking, he is not so in knowledge. Did he commit a sin in humbling himself so that they might be exalted, because he preached God\'s gospel to them free of charge? He robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve Corinth. What he is doing he will continue to do, in order to undermine the claim of those who would like to claim that they work on the same terms as Paul. For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. His servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Paul will boast of his weaknesses—the things that show his weakness: his sufferings, hardships, dangers, beatings, imprisonments, and the anxiety for all the churches.

He knows a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven—whether in the body or out of the body he does not know, God knows. This man was caught up into paradise and heard things that cannot be told, which man may not utter. On behalf of this man Paul will boast, but on his own behalf he will not boast, except of his weaknesses. So to keep him from becoming conceited because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, a thorn was given him in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to harass him. Three times he pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should leave him. But He said, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is made perfect in weakness. Therefore Paul will boast all the more gladly of his weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon him. For the sake of Christ, then, he is content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when he is weak, then he is strong. He has been a fool! They forced him to it, for he ought to have been commended by them. He was not at all inferior to these super-apostles, even though he is nothing.

He warned those who sinned before and all the others, and he warns them now while absent, as he did when present on his second visit, that if he comes again he will not spare them—since they seek proof that Christ is speaking in Paul. Christ is not weak in dealing with them, but is powerful among them. For He was crucified in weakness, but lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in Him, but in dealing with them we will live with Him by the power of God. Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or do you not realize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless indeed you fail to meet the test! Paul hopes they will find that he has not failed the test. He prays to God that they may not do wrong—not that Paul may appear to have met the test, but that they may do what is right. For he cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth. He is glad when he is weak and they are strong. He prays for their restoration. He writes these things while absent, that when he comes he may not have to be severe in his use of the authority that the Lord has given him for building up and not for tearing down. Finally, brothers, rejoice. Aim for restoration, comfort one another, agree with one another, live in peace.

Paul is astonished that they are so quickly deserting Him who called them in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel—not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble them and want to distort the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached, let him be accursed. Am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ. For Paul would have them know that the gospel preached by him is not of human origin. He did not receive it from any man, nor was he taught it, but he received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ. They have heard of his former life in Judaism, how he persecuted the church violently and tried to destroy it.

    summary: 'After fourteen years Paul went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along. He went up because of a revelation and set before them the gospel that he proclaims among the Gentiles. Yet not even Titus, who was with him, was forced to be circumcised, though he was a Greek. False brothers slipped in to spy out the freedom we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might bring us into slavery. To them Paul did not yield in submission even for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might be preserved. Those who seemed to be influential added nothing to him. On the contrary, they saw that Paul had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter to the circumcised. James, Cephas, and John gave the right hand of fellowship to Barnabas and Paul—they should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcised. But when Cephas came to Antioch, Paul opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned. He was eating with the Gentiles, but when certain men came from James, he drew back and separated himself. Even Barnabas was led astray. Paul said before them all: We know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ. We ourselves have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.

    summary: 'O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified. Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith? Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh? Does He who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith? Just as Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness, know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham. The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham: In you shall all the nations be blessed. So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith. For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse. Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us. Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring—who is Christ. The law, which came 430 years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God. Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring should come to whom the promise had been made. The law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith. But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian. For in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith.

    summary: 'The heir, as long as he is a child, is no different from a slave, though he is the owner of everything, but he is under guardians and managers until the date set by his father. In the same way we also, when we were children, were enslaved to the elementary principles of the world. But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba! Father! So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God. Formerly, when they did not know God, they were enslaved to those that by nature are not gods. But now that they have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how can they turn back again to the weak and worthless elementary principles? They observe days and months and seasons and years! Paul is afraid he may have labored over them in vain. He pleads with them. Where is their blessing they felt? They would have gouged out their eyes for him. Has he become their enemy by telling them the truth? Tell me, you who desire to be under the law—Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and one by a free woman. These may be interpreted allegorically: the two women are two covenants.

    summary: 'For freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery. Look: Paul says to them that if they accept circumcision, Christ will be of no advantage to them. Every man who accepts circumcision is obligated to keep the whole law. Those who would be justified by the law are severed from Christ; they have fallen away from grace. For through the Spirit, by faith, we wait for the hope of righteousness. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but only faith working through love. They were running well. Who hindered them from obeying the truth? This persuasion is not from Him who calls them. A little leaven leavens the whole lump. Paul has confidence in the Lord that they will take no other view. The one who is troubling them will bear the penalty. Brothers, if Paul still preaches circumcision, why is he still being persecuted? For they were called to freedom, only do not use freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. The whole law is fulfilled in one word: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. But walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. The works of the flesh are evident, but the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.

    summary: 'Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted. Bear one another\'s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. For if anyone thinks he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself. Let each one test his own work, and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in his neighbor. For each will have to bear his own load. Let the one who is taught the word share all good things with the one who teaches. Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap. For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life. Let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up. So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, and especially to those who are of the household of faith. See with what large letters Paul is writing with his own hand. Those who want to make a good showing in the flesh would force circumcision on them—only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. But far be it from Paul to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to him, and he to the world. For neither circumcision counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation. Peace and mercy be upon all who walk by this rule, upon the Israel of God.',

    title: 'Spiritual Blessings in Christ',
    summary: 'Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, to the saints who are in Ephesus. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before Him. In love He predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of His will, to the praise of His glorious grace, with which He has blessed us in the Beloved. In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace, which He lavished upon us. He made known to us the mystery of His will, to unite all things in Christ, things in heaven and things on earth. In Him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His will. In Him, when they heard the word of truth, the gospel of salvation, and believed, they were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance. Paul prays that they may know the hope of His calling, the riches of His glorious inheritance in the saints, and the immeasurable greatness of His power toward us who believe—the same power with which He raised Christ from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion.',

    title: 'Made Alive in Christ',
    summary: 'And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience—among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved—and raised us up with Him and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages He might show the immeasurable riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them. Therefore remember that at one time you Gentiles in the flesh were separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For He Himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down in His flesh the dividing wall of hostility. He came and preached peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near. So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone.',

    title: 'The Mystery of the Gospel',
    summary: 'For this reason Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of the Gentiles—assuming they have heard of the stewardship of God\'s grace that was given to him for them, how the mystery was made known to him by revelation, as he has written briefly. When they read this they can perceive his insight into the mystery of Christ, which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit. This mystery is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel. Of this gospel Paul was made a minister according to the gift of God\'s grace, which was given him by the working of His power. To Paul, though he is the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things, so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. This was according to the eternal purpose that He has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in Him. Paul bows his knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, that He would grant them to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in their inner being, so that Christ may dwell in their hearts through faith—that they may know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, that they may be filled with all the fullness of God. Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us, to Him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever.',

    title: 'Unity in the Body of Christ',
    summary: 'Paul therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, urges them to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which they have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit—just as they were called to the one hope that belongs to their call—one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all. But grace was given to each one of us according to the measure of Christ\'s gift. Therefore it says, When He ascended on high He led a host of captives, and He gave gifts to men. He who descended is the one who also ascended far above all the heavens, that He might fill all things. And He gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine. Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into Him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together, grows so that it builds itself up in love. Now this Paul says: they must no longer walk as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their minds. They must put off the old self, which belongs to their former manner of life, and be renewed in the spirit of their minds, and put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness. Let no corrupting talk come out of their mouths. Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom they were sealed for the day of redemption. Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from them, along with all malice. Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave them.',

    title: 'Walk in Love and Light',
    summary: 'Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children. And walk in love, as Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God. But sexual immorality and all impurity or covetousness must not even be named among them, as is proper among saints. Let there be no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking, which are out of place, but instead let there be thanksgiving. For they may be sure of this, that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure, or who is covetous (that is, an idolater), has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. Let no one deceive them with empty words. For because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. Therefore do not become partners with them; for at one time they were darkness, but now they are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light, for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true. Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them. Look carefully then how they walk, not as unwise but as wise, making the best use of the time, because the days are evil. Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but be filled with the Spirit, addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with their heart, giving thanks always and for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, His body, and is Himself its Savior. Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her, that He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of water with the word, so that He might present the church to Himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing. This mystery is profound, and Paul is saying that it refers to Christ and the church.',

    summary: 'Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. Honor your father and mother—this is the first commandment with a promise—that it may go well with them and they may live long in the land. Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. Bondservants, obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling, with a sincere heart, as you would Christ, not by the way of eye-service, as people-pleasers, but as bondservants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, rendering service with a good will as to the Lord and not to man, knowing that whatever good anyone does, this he will receive back from the Lord. Masters, do the same to them, and stop your threatening, knowing that He who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and that there is no partiality with Him. Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might. Put on the whole armor of God, that they may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that they may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm. Stand therefore, having fastened on the belt of truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and, as shoes for their feet, having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace. In all circumstances take up the shield of faith, with which they can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one; and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. To that end, keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints, and also for Paul, that words may be given to him in opening his mouth boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gospel.',

    title: 'To Live Is Christ',
    summary: 'Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons: Grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Paul thanks God in all his remembrance of them, always in every prayer making his requests with joy, because of their partnership in the gospel from the first day until now. And he is sure of this, that He who began a good work in them will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ. It is right for Paul to feel this way about them all, because he holds them in his heart, for they are all partakers with him of grace, both in his imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel. Paul yearns for them all with the affection of Christ Jesus. And this is his prayer, that their love may abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment, so that they may approve what is excellent, and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ. Now Paul wants them to know that what has happened to him has really served to advance the gospel, so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to all the rest that his imprisonment is for Christ. Most of the brothers, having become confident in the Lord by his imprisonment, are much more bold to speak the word without fear. Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will. What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that Paul rejoices. For Paul knows that this will turn out for his deliverance through their prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, as it is his eager expectation and hope that he will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage Christ will be honored in his body, whether by life or by death. For to Paul, to live is Christ, and to die is gain.',

    title: 'The Mind of Christ',
    summary: 'So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, complete Paul\'s joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though He was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. Therefore, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure. Do all things without grumbling or disputing, that they may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom they shine as lights in the world, holding fast to the word of life. Paul hopes in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to them soon. He is genuinely concerned for their welfare. But Paul trusts in the Lord that shortly he himself will come also. He has thought it necessary to send Epaphroditus, their messenger who ministered to Paul\'s need, for he nearly died for the work of Christ.',

    title: 'Knowing Christ Above All',
    summary: 'Finally, brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things is no trouble to Paul and is safe for them. Look out for the dogs, look out for the evildoers, look out for those who mutilate the flesh. For we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh—though Paul himself has reason for confidence in the flesh also. If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, Paul has more: circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless. But whatever gain he had, he counted as loss for the sake of Christ. Indeed, Paul counts everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus his Lord. For His sake he has suffered the loss of all things and counts them as rubbish, in order that he may gain Christ and be found in Him, not having a righteousness of his own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith—that he may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and may share His sufferings, becoming like Him in His death, that by any means possible he may attain the resurrection from the dead. Not that Paul has already obtained this or is already perfect, but he presses on to make it his own, because Christ Jesus has made him his own. Brothers, he does not consider that he has made it his own. But one thing he does: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, he presses on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. Our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform our lowly body to be like His glorious body.',

    summary: 'Therefore, brothers, whom Paul loves and longs for, his joy and crown, stand firm thus in the Lord. He entreats Euodia and Syntyche to agree in the Lord. Yes, he asks his true companion to help these women, who have labored side by side with him in the gospel together with Clement and the rest of his fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life. Rejoice in the Lord always; again he will say, rejoice. Let your reasonableness be known to everyone. The Lord is at hand; do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. What they have learned and received and heard and seen in Paul—practice these things, and the God of peace will be with them. Paul rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length they have revived their concern for him. Not that he is speaking of being in need, for he has learned in whatever situation he is to be content. He knows how to be brought low, and he knows how to abound. In any and every circumstance, he has learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. He can do all things through Him who strengthens him. Yet it was kind of them to share his trouble. No church entered into partnership with him in giving and receiving except them only. Even in Thessalonica they sent help for his needs. Not that Paul seeks the gift, but he seeks the fruit that increases to their credit. And my God will supply every need of yours according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.',

    title: 'The Supremacy of Christ',
    summary: 'Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the saints and faithful brothers in Christ at Colossae: Grace and peace from God our Father. Paul thanks God always when he prays for them, since he heard of their faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that they have for all the saints, because of the hope laid up for them in heaven. Of this they have heard before in the word of the truth, the gospel, which has come to them, as indeed in the whole world it is bearing fruit and increasing—as it also does among them, since the day they heard it and understood the grace of God in truth. Paul does not cease to pray for them, asking that they may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, so as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to Him: bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God; being strengthened with all power, according to His glorious might, for all endurance and patience with joy; giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified them to share in the inheritance of the saints in light. He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. For by Him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created through Him and for Him. And He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together. And He is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything He might be preeminent. For in Him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through Him to reconcile to Himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of His cross.',

    title: 'Fullness in Christ Alone',
    summary: 'For Paul wants them to know how great a struggle he has for them and for those at Laodicea and for all who have not seen him face to face, that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, to reach all the riches of full assurance of understanding and the knowledge of God\'s mystery, which is Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. Paul says this in order that no one may delude them with plausible arguments. For though he is absent in body, yet he is with them in spirit, rejoicing to see their good order and the firmness of their faith in Christ. Therefore, as they received Christ Jesus the Lord, so they are to walk in Him, rooted and built up in Him and established in the faith, just as they were taught, abounding in thanksgiving. See to it that no one takes them captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ. For in Him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily, and they have been filled in Him, who is the head of all rule and authority. In Him also they were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, having been buried with Him in baptism, in which they were also raised with Him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised Him from the dead. And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This He set aside, nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in Him. Therefore let no one pass judgment on them in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath.

They are to set their minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. For they have died, and their life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ who is their life appears, then they also will appear with Him in glory. They are to put to death therefore what is earthly in them: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. On account of these the wrath of God is coming. In these they too once walked, when they were living in them. But now they must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from their mouths. They are not to lie to one another, seeing that they have put off the old self with its practices and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator. Here there is not Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all, and in all. They are to put on then, as God\'s chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven them, so they also must forgive. And above all these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony. And let the peace of Christ rule in their hearts, to which indeed they were called in one body. And be thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in them richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in their hearts to God. And whatever they do, in word or deed, they are to do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him. Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives, and do not be harsh with them. Children, obey your parents in everything. Fathers, do not provoke your children.',

At the same time, pray also for Paul and his companions, that God may open to them a door for the word, to declare the mystery of Christ, on account of which Paul is in prison—that he may make it clear, which is how he ought to speak. Walk in wisdom toward outsiders, making the best use of the time. Let their speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that they may know how they ought to answer each person. Tychicus will tell them all about Paul\'s activities. He is a beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord. Paul has sent him to them for this very purpose, that they may know how they are and that he may encourage their hearts, and with him Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of them. They will tell them of everything that has taken place. Aristarchus, Paul\'s fellow prisoner, greets them, and Mark the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom they have received instructions—if he comes to them, they are to welcome him), and Jesus who is called Justus. These are the only men of the circumcision among Paul\'s fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and they have been a comfort to him. Epaphras, who is one of them, a servant of Christ Jesus, greets them, always struggling on their behalf in his prayers, that they may stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God. For Paul bears him witness that he has worked hard for them and for those in Laodicea and in Hierapolis. Luke the beloved physician greets them, as does Demas. Give Paul\'s greetings to the brothers at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house. And when this letter has been read among them, have it also read in the church of the Laodiceans; and see that they also read the letter from Laodicea.
